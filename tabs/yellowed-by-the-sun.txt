G                              C               G
The color of your bones it was yellowed by the sun
         Em                              C               G
Ain't no reason why the drummer keeps on drumming on the drum
       Em           C        G
On his drum, we are only for awhile

        G                              C
And the truth is like an onion you can skin it layer by layer
         Em                             C                    G
When you come upon the center you might find there's nothing there
            Em            C        G
Aint nothin there, we are only for awhile

The sun is like the truth it'll burn the mortal man

If he tries to look upon it if he tries to understand
         E                 C        G
He might learn that we are only for awhile

G                     C                G
Even my guitar listen while she gently weeps
      Em                           C                G
Now I will not play forever so why would I play for keeps

Don't play for keeps we are only for awhile
