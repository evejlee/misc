Snow Leopard updates:
------------------------------

Macports for numpy/scipy/matplotlib is now working if you are willing to fix a
crash mid-way through installs.

Do this first so programs can link against readline:

	easy_install readline

Install numpy:

	sudo port install py26-numpy

This installs gcc43.  Stopped with an odd failure installing python 2.6.  Had
to run this:

	sudo port -f activate python26 @2.6.4_0+

Now scipy:

	sudo port install py26-scipy

Worked.

	sudo port install py26-matplotlib

The install worked, and simple tests also work.

	sudo port install py26-ipython

Also worked, but note you still have to do the easy_install of readline below.

PROBLEM:  sfile doesn't seem to work properly.


Everything fink is broken due to the updates to gcc and going all 64-bit.


So I'm doing it from scratch. Forget scipy+gfortran let's just get numpy and my
extensions going, maybe matplotlib.

DO NOT install ipython from easy_install, it will attempt to put crap into
/usr/local/bin, and unfortunately there is no easy_uninstall

DO install readline with easy_install.

	easy_install readline

Then install numpy/matplotlib with my own installer
	einstall -c numpy
	einstall -c matplotlib
numpy works fine but matplotlib fails.  I think this is because it needs
libpng or something.



tried this:
	easy_install numpy
		installed 1.3.0, seems ok.  No fortran stuff of course (and thus
		no scipy).

Tried:
	easy_install matplotlib
but it got confused by the incorrect naming of files there.  And there is
no egg on the download site anyway for 10.6/python 2.6.  Oh well.

then tried building my self and stuff from numpy could not be found, apparently
the easyinstall failed to copy some files.  Ok, roll my own.
	

Then use this to get ipython which will see the readline we installed before.
	einstall -c ipython

Turn off moving spaces while dragging a window near the edge of the
screen.  You can't really do it, but you can change the delay
time to be really long:

	defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-edge-delay -float 100; killall Dock



Tried just using spotlight instead of quicksilver, see how it goes

Turned off auto-login

Found new vim now!  7.2

got .pac files and subversion server files and mysetup.sh files from my laptop
with usb stick.  Set up networking to use .pac file for corus until I can get
firefox loaded.

subversion needs to use the proxy, and I keep that file in subversion!
so had to make .subversion/servers and set that to corus

set capslock to control
set spaces to not go to space with open windows when an application is 
	focused.

run mysetup.sh to check out my svn repo and set soft link

had problem that xterm-256colors was always being set, how to check?

menumeters

XCode - downloaded latest (search Xcode download)	

Got latest version of xquarts (X11-2.3.1.pkg)
This included an xterm that works with 256 color!

Got fink:

	Got source installer which always works better.  Set http proxy
	??What if I'm off site?

	# screen
	fink install screen
	# had to recompile with 256 color support
	sudo vim /sw/fink/10.5/stable/main/finkinfo/utils/screen.info
	# note if using unstable branch might have to change path
	# add --enable-colors256 in ConfigureParams
	fink rebuild screen

	# mrxvt
	# ran into a mirror problem for imake but I eventually found a good mirror
	# seems to support 256 colors out of the box
	fink install mrxvt
	
X11 setup:
	Focus follows mouse:
		defaults write org.x.X11 wm_ffm -bool true 

	Don't start the xterm, just run something that does nothing.  hmm..this
	doesn't seem to work any more!
		defaults write org.x.X11_launcher app_to_run /usr/X11/bin/xprop
	And to make it start xterm again
		defaults write org.x.X11_launcher app_to_run /usr/X11/bin/xterm

mrxvt:
	Easy to get apple-v pasting!  Just added this to mrxvtrc.fangorn
	mrxvt.macro.Meta+v: Paste
