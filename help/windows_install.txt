took more than an hour to format the 320 Gb hard drive.

Installation straightforward.  Did an initial step then
rebooted.  Began copying files and was going along
smoothly but now seems to be stalled on a screen saying the 
setup will finish in 33 minutes. Took a picture. It is
during the device install.  Stupid me, I thought this was
just another helper tip which had been displayed 
through all the previous stuff, but it actually wanted
me to type something!


Had annoying noise through the headphones that
was associated with the "speaker" attachment.  The latter 
is no longer attached.  Also noise from loose USB
cable.
