I currently just make sure the setup.py has the right metadata and then do
    python setup.py register.

Then go to pypi and upload the file.  You can automate it with

    python setup.py sdist upload

But sdist won't put everything in there.  Apparently I can write a MANIFEST.in
that will specify everything that needs to go in.

For a new release, just update the metadata and repeat above.
