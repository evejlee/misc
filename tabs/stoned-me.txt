G                    D                   C                G
Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came purin down
             D                    C               G
me and billy standin there with a silver half a crown
              D                   C                  G
hands full of fishin gear and the tackle on our backs
                    D                   C                      G
we just stood there gettin wet with our backs against the fence

Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Em                     
hope it don't rain all day 

Chorus

       G         C
And it stoned me to my soul
G                   D
stoned me just like jelly roll
       C      G
and it stoned me

       G         C
And it stoned me to my soul
G                   D
stoned me just like goin home
       C      G
and it stoned me

        G                   D                C                 G
And the rain let up and the sun came out and we were gettin dry
              D            C                  G
almost glad a pickup truck nearly passed us by
                              D                     C                   G
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up the road
                             D                      C               G
we looked at the swim and we jumped right in not to mention fishin poles

Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Em                     
let it wash all over me

chorus


       G                 D                   C                     G
On the way back home we sang a song, but our throats were gettin dry
                          D                        C               G
Then we saw the man from across the road, with the sunshine in his eyes
                               D                       C                 G
Well he lived all alone in his own little home, with a great big gallon jar
                                D                  C                    G
There were bottles too, one for me and you, and he said "hey, there you are"

Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Am        D
ohhhh the water
Em                     
get it myself from the mountain stream

chorus
