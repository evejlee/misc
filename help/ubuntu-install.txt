latex
---------------------

texlive wouldn't process any of my documents. 

New versions of natbib are much more strict.  

    Package natbib Error: Bibliography not compatible with author-year citations. 

My "myunsrt.bst" style file (based on original unsrt.bst) was somehow not up to
snuff.  Also, the new system version "unsrtnat.bst" which is adapted to the new
natbib, can't handle urls.  This seems like a step back!  I noticed that
ADS has now fixed their urls to be essentially uninformative because
of this.  So I removed urls from all my references.


this is a big one, apparently essentially every document every written
by me can no longer be processed.

First the problem was revtex4 is not available, only revtex4-1
(I installed texlive-publishers where it should live?)

apparently I just had to edit emulateapj and change revtex4 to revtex4-1


fonts
---------------------
To get bitmapped fonts going in apps like gnome-terminal and
xfce4-terminal 


Add a new file:
/etc/fonts/conf.d/69-zzz_fixedfonts.conf

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
    <!-- Enabled Fixed bitmap fonts -->
    <selectfont>
        <acceptfont>
            <pattern>
                <patelt name="family"><string>Fixed</string></patelt>
            </pattern>
        </acceptfont>
    </selectfont>
</fontconfig>

sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig

I also copied zevv-peep into /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc and did the same as above
with the family name peep.  It only provides a big font, but it looks really nice.
My big complaint is that non-ascii characters sometimes don't fit the bounding box.
The conf file is /etc/fonts/conf.d/69-zzz_peep.conf

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
    <!-- Enabled peep fonts -->
    <selectfont>
        <acceptfont>
            <pattern>
                <patelt name="family"><string>peep</string></patelt>
            </pattern>
        </acceptfont>
    </selectfont>
</fontconfig>



saving gnome-terminal config
-----------------------------------
These are in here:

~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/{name}/%gconf.xml

Where the {name} are Profile0, Profile1 etc and the name you see in
the gnome-terminal gui is actually in the %gconf.xml file

eups installs
---------------------------

numpy

    install python-dev, gfortran, liblapack-dev (will grab blas and atlas)
    einstall -c numpy

biggles

    can't use plotutils from ubuntu, use einstall
    aptitude install libxaw7-dev
    einstall -c plotutils

    einstall -c biggles

Karmic removed trayer and also removed ability to run user .xsession

I created this file:
/usr/share/xsessions/custom.desktop and put the following in it:

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Custom
Comment=Custom Xsession
Exec=/etc/X11/Xsession
TryExec=xterm
Icon=
Type=Application
X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gdm
X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gdm



Feisty-fawn: Had to run from alternate cd with fancy new hardware.

I partitioned the 2nd disk (500 Gb) for Ubuntu.  It can boot off a different
disk.

Watch it when it gets to choosing resolutions.  You will think you should hit
enter to choose a res, but you should use space, then enter finalizes.

Second time:
After install need to go to safe mode.  apt-get update and upgrade everything.  
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade

Then wget the latest version of envy and run it. It will restart.  e.g.
http://albertomilone.com/ubuntu/nvidia/scripts/envy_0.9.7-0ubuntu12_all.deb
dpkg -i envy_0.9.7-0ubuntu12_all.deb


Here is where things might need tweaking:

I still couldn't log in.  So from recovery mode I su'd to esheldon and then
startx worked.  From there new updates showed up even though I had done an
upgrade and this was a new kernel.  I installed, but then the drivers wouldn't
work with new kernel.  Had to re-run envy purging old then re-installing (which
compiles against kernel).  Then I was set for normal log in.

Maybe try to force the 3 kernel updates from the first recovery mode start.
