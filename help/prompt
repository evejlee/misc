I finally figured out why when you use up arrow to find previous
commands on the alpha's the display gets messed up.  Our .cshrc files all
contain something like this at the top:


set Pp=''
if ($?prompt) then
  set Pr = `hostname`
  set Pp = `echo $Pr | sed -e "sx\.x xg" | awk ' { print $1 }' `
  set prompt = "${Pp}$cwd>"
  
  stty kill ^U intr ^C erase '^?' crt -tabs
endif

#alias commands set prompt to full path of current working directory
alias sp 'set prompt = "${Pp}$cwd>"
alias cd 'chdir \!* && sp'



The problem is in the stty command.  Remove the -tabs and everything
works great.  Its unnecessary anyway.


About the prompt:

If using the full path of the current working directory as prompt leaves 
you too little room to type, then you might get rid of the ${cwd} or 
try one of these alternatives:

1) Just show the current directory name instead of the whole path

alias sp 'set prompt = "${Pp}:${cwd:t}>"'

2) Put a newline character in:

alias sp 'set prompt = "${Pp}:$cwd\n>"'
