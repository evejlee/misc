objc_type uses pdf - cmodel, summed all bands.

questions:  Is the fraction of stars/galaxies really different close to the
plane, or is it just a plotting artifact?

The bayesian s/g stuff is a sliding concentration cut as a function of seeing
and mag, with prior on number of stars/galaxies as a function of mag from the
coadds.

commissioning: 180/square degree
main survey: 150/square degree

general
When making lambda/eta plots always overplot a line representing the equator

lrg
try just running with the i-band concentration cut on datasweeps, plus a
smaller run on fpObjc and just see what is missed by just running on sweeps.

Make some postage stamps, ask nikhil about root for viewing

/commissioning flag and add a header keyword

add link to density quasars from previous page

look at mmt but only primaries and see if I still get Adam's number density.
