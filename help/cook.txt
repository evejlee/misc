beef loin shell steak
---------------------

Started out with two chimneys, but couldn't get temp over 160 (probably 200 on
my grill?) After ~hour I added more and it got to 180.  Kept it there for rest
of the time.  Total time of 2.5 hours.  Meat was 140 when I checked, and ended
up being slightly over medium.  Probably should have checked a bit earlier,
since at 2 hours meat was at 120.

I put two boxes of apple wood chips on; the first near the beginning and the
second when I added another chimney.  It did better off to the side; when
placed on the coals it was spent quickly. This was *plenty* of smoking.

** Get a digital thermometer and meat thermometer!!! **

The marinade had too much vinigar for me; vinegar in the balsamic and the
worshesteshire .  I would prefer something a bit more subtle, but not sure what
to change.  The soy sauce seems like a good idea still.

    3 parts olive oil
    1 part balsamic
    < 1 part worshesteshir 
    < 1 part soy sauce
    < 1 part minced carlic
    forgot the mustard completely.
    lots of black pepper
    some ceyanne
    little bit onion powder

Salmon & tofu
--------------
I put in two full stacks but the temp on the thermo (built int) never
rose above 160, which might be ~200. This is OK I thought for the fish.
I put a metal box of mesquite on.

After an hour the fish was done, but it was not ~125-140 in the center, more
like 115.  this is worrying me a little, we shall see how I feel later.

The tofu did not seem done after an hour; at this time the temp was reading
140.  I added another chimney and am putting it on for another hour.  It never
did get over 160!  Note sure what's up, maybe outside temp.  Even after another
hour the tofu was just a little brown on top and had not absorbed much flavor.
