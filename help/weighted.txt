Concerning weighted variances:

let the mean value of the values X[i] be designated as <X>

Unweighted Variance:

      var = (1/N)*sum( X[i] - <X>)                    (1)

Cern web page formula for weighted variance:

     Define:
	W[i] = 1/SIGMA[i]^2
	Wtot = sum(W[i])

     wvar = 1/Wtot^2 * sum( w[i]^2*(x[i] - <X>)^2 )   (2)

When all the sigma's are the same:

     wvar = (1/N^2)sum(x[i] - <X>) = var/N            (3)

     wsig = sig/sqrt(N)

There formula isn't really a variance, its more like a weighted
uncertainty in the mean value.

I think the weighted variance should be more like this:

     wvar = 1/Wtot*sum(wi*(x[i] - <X>)^2 )            (4)

which reduces to the unweighted formula for all sigma the same.

There is more motivation for this formula than 'it works.'  We are using the 
weights as a sort of distribution function in a sense.  If we think
of it that way, then the variance has to be (4); just the average
deviation where our distribution function is the weights.  By using
this weighting scheme, we hope that things far from the true mean
are the ones with large errors just like using a probability function
gives little weight to points far from the mean of the distribution.

Also, we expect the _uncertainty_ to drop off as the intrinsic
sigma over the square root of N  sig/sqrt(N).  This is what the
Cern formula does (3).
