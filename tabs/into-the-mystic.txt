     E
     We were born before the wind
     E
     Also younger than the sun
     B
     'Ere the bonny boat was won
     B                     E
     As we sailed into the mystic

     E
     Hark, now, hear the sailor's cry
     E
     Smell the sea and feel the sky
     B
     Let your soul and spirit fly
     B          E
     Into the mystic.

     G#m                       A

     G#m                       A     
     When that foghorn whistle blows,
     B

         E
     And I  wanna rock you gypsy soul
     E
     ahhh.. Just like way back in the days of old
     B
     And magnificently we will float
                E
     Into the mystic
