I currently just make sure the setup.py has the right metadata and then do
    python setup.py register.

Then go to pypi and upload the file.  You can automate it with

    python setup.py sdist upload

But sdist won't put everything in there.  Apparently I can write a MANIFEST.in
that will specify everything that needs to go in.

Now when I do a new release, how do I get the new release info into there? Do I
re-register with a new version in the setup.py?
