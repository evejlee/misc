# user defined types.
# you must add the correct include at the top of vector.h
# that defines Point and Box types

# the C type is Point
# we want to use a shorter name pvector, e.g.
#    pvector* = pvector_new();
Point:
    shortname: p

# the C type is Box
# we want to write box_vector
#    box_vector* = box_vector_new();
Box:
    shortname: "box_"
