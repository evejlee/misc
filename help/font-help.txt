Note, this no longer seems to work in ubuntu


To get fixed and peep (bitmapped) font working in debian:

Ensure xfonts-100dpi is installed
dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config
    And say "yes" to the question about bitmapped fonts.

Works in xfce4-terminal but not gnome-terminal currently.

Then I had to reset the fonts for firefox under 
    edit/preferences/content/fonts&colors/advanced
    Fonts for: Western
    Proportional: Serif Size: 16
    Serif: serif
    Sans-serif: sans-serif
    Monospace: monospace Size: 12
    

To get some fonts to work in my ~/.fonts directory have to run mkfontdir
~/.fonts
