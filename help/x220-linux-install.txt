I first tried arch linux, but udev could not find my ethernet card.

So, ubuntu it is.

For ubuntu, can use usb-creator (ubuntu based distros only) to make a bootable
usb for installation.  I tried Lubuntu 11

The install fails if I try using the usb port on the back left.  It succeeds
using the front left.


After install, easiest way to get started is using the stuff on the eeebuntu
3.0 labeled usb stick (relabel it!).  get the id_rsa* stuff off there and put
it in ~/.ssh.  Then install 
    ssh-askpass
    keychain 
    
and you should be good to go.  There is a version of mysetup.sh on there. If it is out of date, just get it from the webfactional account.

Note I could not get Xmodmap or Xdefaults to work under lxde. Need to look into
it.

capslock
--------

I found this advice on making capslock control in the console. I used
this to make capslock another ctrl

Edit /etc/default/keyboard

        XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"

then run

        sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh console-setup

NOTE: this wasn't supposed to help with X11 but it seems
to; in lxde it is working

XSession
--------

I put XSession.desktop file  under /usr/share/xsessions/

IMPORTANT NOTE: you DO seem to need the display manager or else lots of things
you won't have permission to run, like the nm-applet, mounting usb drives from
pcman, and some other device related things. I'm sure I could figure this out
but for now this isn't too intolerable.

This seems pam related: lxdm has permissions for this stuff.

try workaround:
    I implemented the dbus hack, using group netdev instead
    of network, as I was already in it
    https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=63576

    Make sure to launch xmonad with 
        exec ck-launch-session xmonad

    And put this at the bottom of /etc/pam.d/login

        session optional pam_loginuid.so
        session optional pam_ck_connector.so



problems

    Lots that were resolved by just using the damned XSession, related
    to what I said above that lxdm has permissions to do certain
    things that I don't.

    fbpanel didn't look right because I needed to use a dark gtk theme, but
    setting it under the lxde session didn't progagate after reboot.

    Tried gtk-theme-switch and installing a dark gtk theme and it works.
    clealooks-darkorange is my fav but I had to alter the INSENSITIVE
    (widgets/buttons not pushable) to be a better color. this is not under
    dotfiles/gtk-themes. 

LXSession
---------

Tried using LXSession seems to be a good way to manage things like autostart.
But in the end it doesn't help me any.

But here's how it works:
 
There is a new area ~/.dotfiles/lxsession/xmonad that you should linke under
~/.config/lxsession

In the desktop.conf you specify the window manager is xmonad, and you
can do things like set the key repeat speed (although I figure out you
can do that with xset)

Then 
    exec lxsession -s xmonad 

instead of xmonad in the ~/.xsession file.  

I still had a problem with gnome-keyring running multiple instances, so
I added a killall gnome-keyring to the top of the xsession file.  This is
at

    ~/.dotfiles/X/xinitrc.lxsession

One nice thing is the ability to use lxsession-logout or (lxde-logout I
suppose), which is a nice dialog that allows logging out, rebooting, shutting
down, etc.  so that's a way to avoid going back to the display manager.

But on the other hand I can't just get out with a key stroke, using alt-shift-q
will leave the session running.

Grub
---------
I don't like not seeing the printed text.

in grub 2.0 you edit kernel mode lines by editing
    /etc/default/grub

I removed 
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

Leave it blank to print all the info but still bring
up a display manager.

Replace with this to skip the display manager.
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"


Then ran
    sudo update-grub

That worked.
