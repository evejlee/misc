# simple rules:
#    - declare objects using 
#          name = object
#    - Everything is separated by whitespace and whitespace has no meaning
#    - Comments start with # and are considered white space till the end of
#      the line
#    - Use double quotes around strings that contain white space.  Escape
#      internal double quotes using \"
#    - Arrays are denoted by [ ] and elements are white space separated
#    - sub-configurations are donoted by { } and the syntax inside
#      the sub-config is the same as the overall file.


# numbers or strings can just be bare tokens
dblval = 3.14159

# use double quotes if the token contains white space
greeting = "hello world"   # comment at end

# The next field is separated by white space, so you can do this if you really
# want
lonval = 27 after=21.5

sval = hello  # same as sval="hello"

# you can escape double quotes
embed = "I love \"quoting\" things"

multiline_string = "
    hello
    world
"

# An array. Fields in an array are also separated by white space (but you can
# add commas if you just can't help yourself)
darr = [22.5 -8.79 22.53453234e3 -1.64]

# containers can cross lines, it is just more white space
arr = ["first"
       "on another line"   # comment inside
       "last"]             # comment after

qval = "what's up?"

# arrays can be empty
empty = []

# internally everything is stored as a string and converted to the requested
# type when calling the cfg_get_* routines.
#
# If you want to extract arrays of numbers, *all* elements must be convertible
# to numbers.  The following would give an error as numbers but is OK as an
# array of strings.
