Obviously you've already gone a round with the ref, so you aren't interested in
nit-picky stuff.  But one thing I noticed is certain wordings that aren't
technically right, but are often used.  An example is in the abstract, "This
paper also describes".  You, the author, are describing, but the paper is an
inanimate object so it doesn't describe anything.  Another example is in the
first paragraph of the intro, "the primary distance measure is the baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) technique".  You can use techniques to measure
things, but techniques aren't measures. It is the *feature* itself that is the
measure.  

Anyway, the paper is quite far along, I just wanted to point it out.

abstract

    The sentence "The completeness compared to all quasars identified in BOSS
    data is 65%." I find a little confusing.  


intro

    P2

        "...leading to potential incompleteness and inefficiency in target
        selection".  It seems to me it is really just an efficiency issue.  You
        can be very complete if you target everything, but your efficiency will
        be crap.
