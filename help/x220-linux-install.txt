I first tried arch linux, but udev could not find my ethernet card.

So, ubuntu it is.

For ubuntu, can use usb-creator to make a bootable usb for installation.
I tried Lubuntu 11

The install fails if I try using the usb port on the back left.  It succeeds
using the front left.


After install, easiest way to get started us using the stuff on the eeebuntu
3.0 labeled usb stick (relabel it!).  get the id_rsa* stuff off there and put
it in ~/.ssh.  Then install 
    ssh-askpass
    keychain 
    
and you should be good to go.  There is a version of mysetup.sh on there. If it is out of date, just get it from the webfactional account.

Note I could not get Xmodmap or Xdefaults to work under lxde. Need to look into
it.


XSession
--------

I put XSession.desktop file  under /usr/share/xsessions/

NOTE: you DO need the display manager or else lots of things you won't have
permission to run, like the nm-applet and some other device related things.

problems

    fbpanel didn't look right because I needed to use a
    dark gtk theme, but setting it under lxde didn't progagate.


    Tried gtk-theme-switch and installing a dark gtk theme and it works.
    midnight osx seems good.


LXSession
---------

Trying to use an lxsession to see if there are any benefits.

        ~/.config/lxsession/xmonad/desktop.conf 

And specify the window manager is xmonad there.  Then exec lxsession -s xmonad
instead of xmonad in the ~/.xsession file.

One nice thing is the ability to use lxsession-logout or (lxde-logout I
suppose), which is a nice dialog that allows logging out, rebooting, shutting
down, etc.  so that's a way to avoid going back to the display manager.

But on the other hand I can't just get out with a key stroke, using alt-shift-q
will leave the session running.

Grub
---------
I don't like the not seeing the printed text.

in grub 2.0 you edit kernel mode lines by editing
    /etc/default/grub

I removed 
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

Leave it blank to print all the info but still bring
up a display manager.

Replace with this to skip the display manager.
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"


Then ran
    sudo update-grub

That worked.
