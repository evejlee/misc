Mostly hardware stuff

Doing "slow" active optics

	just do some test images as a function of altitude make a table and use the
	lookup table.  Need to have "donut" images to correct for next image
	to tweak around the model.

SW
	
	not so long in sim mode would be better.  Work with data
	as soon as possible.

	used other data sets they think too much since new optics
	means new problems.

	instrumental effects worked with too late

	and don't spend too much time on hardware things that will get fixed.
