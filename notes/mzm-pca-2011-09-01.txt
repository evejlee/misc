Generally:

    You often leave out "the" and other small words.  E.g.

        "This may be a concern when correlated PSF noise level is high."
                                    ^ missing "the"

abstract

    You should spell out PSF and PCA the first time.

    "spatially correlated PSF noise *can* be mistaken as signal"

    "Grid based PSF interpolation faces..."  A grid can't face anything :) You
    should probably say, "One challenge presented by grid based PSF
    interpolation is the possibility of empty cells", or something like that.
        
        Also, you should explain that you are using stars to determine the PSF,
        so that the missing data means there are no stars in the cell.

    "Expectation ..."  -> "We used Expectation Maximization to deal with this
    missing data"

    "We find that the fit residual"  Is this residual higher meaning there is
    higher variance only or is it systematic?
    
    "Finally..." I think you are addressing the linear interpolation between
    cells. You should probably spell this out.

Introduction

    p1

        You should again re-introduce the PSF acronym (and others).

        Another systematic is the correction for the PSF.  Even if the PSF is
        known perfectly, the current algorithms don't correct it perfectly.

        "In this work ..." -> "In this work we concentrate on PSF
        interpolation".
    p2

        I think you can be more general here, no need to limit this to future
        surveys.  Your method is applicable to SDSS too.

    p3

        "approaches to interpolating" -> "approaches to PSF interpolation"

        Use a colon: "interpolation: underlying physics...."

        "Underlying physics modeling" I think you can just say "physical
        modeling"

        "..method that uses".  Methods can't use anything, only people can :)
        You can say: "In the first approach, we fit models to stellar images
        that represent the physical state of the telescope, optics, and
        atmosphere at the time of observation, such as defocus and seeing."

        "This has been show..."  -> "This method has been shown to accurately
        recover the true PSF for space-based missions where only a few 
        well understood parameters are sufficient to model the PSF"

        " apply similar strategy" 
                ^ a

        "encouraging partially"
                    ^ ,

        "difficulty..." -> perhaps "difficulty of modeling ground based
        systems, for which the PSF is less stable" ?

        "including" -> "include"

        Spell out PCA the first time in the main text.

    p4

        I think it would be better to begin by explaining what PCA is in
        general, then moving to how it applies to this particular problem.

        "individual image does"
                         ^ s do

        "help" -> I think this can be tied back into your explanation of what
        PCA is, also help is not the best word.
