CVS Archive for UM astrophysics IDL code
----------------------------------------

I have set up a CVS archive running on sdss3 which contains all the
active idl code written at UM for ROTSE and the SDSS. This code is
contained in a directory structure which looks like this:

um_idl
	umrotse_idl
		match
		doc
		newpipe
		pipeline
		temptools
		tools
		variables
	umsdss_idl
		bin
		ctio
		temp
		tools


There will always be a copy of this directory tree located under 
/sdss3/products/idltools, so ordinarily all you have to do is have this
directory in your idl path to get the official versions of the code.

The primary purpose of the archive is to neatly organize the code which
we extensively share. It is not a place to dump every personalized bit of
code you write, but only those which are parts of generally available
tools.

For now I would like to restrict write access to the archive a bit, though
I may relax that if things go smoothly. If you are developing code which is 
to go into this archive there are two ways you can proceed. 

     1: If it is new code, just develop it in your own area. Once you are
        satisfied with the code, think it is ready for others to use,
	and have properly documented and formatted it, you can pass it
	off to someone with access to the archive and they will add and
	check in the code. I think this will be the standard routine for
	code developed by undergrads.

     2: If you are modifying archive code, you will have to 'check out'
        a copy of the code into your own area, then modify it there. 
	When you are done, it will again have to be checked back in. If
	you don't have write access you will have to hand it off to 
	someone who does. Remember that making modifications to archive	
	code can create problems in other code, so this will have to be
	done carefully.

All this has to be done on sdss3. Checking out a copy of the code:
 
     0: You must have the line:
	    setenv CVSROOT /sdss3/products/cvs/cvsroot
	in your .cshrc file

     1: Go to a directory in your development (perhaps idl.lib?) and 
        type 'cvs co um_idl'. This will create a complete copy of the
	code for you to work with. It will appear under um_idl in the
	directory from which you called it.

     2: You can modify the code in this directory tree all you like. There
        are a number of ways you can compare what you have done with the
	archive. Commands like:
		 cvs diff 'filename'
		 cvs status 'filename'
	will tell you about whether you have altered the file. The command:
		 cvs update
	will update the code in your directory to include any changes
	others have made. It will NOT update files which you have altered 
	in the meantime!

     3: Finally, to check code in, you use:
		 cvs commit
	This will prompt you with an editor to enter some comments describing
	what you have done. YOU MUST HAVE WRITE ACCESS TO DO THIS.
		 
     4: To add a new file file to the archive you first put it in the 
	directory where it will go, then type:
		  cvs add filename  (schedule it to be added)
		  cvs commit	    (actually add it)

For now the people with write access to the archive are:
    Me
    Erin Sheldon
    Bob Kehoe
I will probably add a lot of others as time goes on, but I want to start
carefully. Note that EVERYONE can check out and monitor all the code, you
just can't all check _in_ changes yet.
