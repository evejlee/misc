On ubuntu
----------------

You need to set up the custom desktop, as ubuntu no longer supports running the
.xsession.  See help for unbutu install.

Need to install
    xmonad
    xmobar
    dmenu

    And a panel/trayer
        trayer (from ~/ccode/trayer_1.0-2_amd64.deb using dpkg -i debfile)
        OR
        fbpanel

Link the proper xmobarrc and xmonad.hs file.  Last time it was
    xmobarrc -> xmobarrc-treebeard
    xmonad.hs -> xmonad-desktop.hs

Link the proper xsession file, last time was 
    .xsession -> .dotfiles/X/xinitrc.xmonad.treebeard

Then all should work.


Using fbpanel
----------------------------------
This is a much better option than trayer I think.


first install libglib and libgtk dev packages
    sudo aptitude install libglib2.0-dev
    sudo aptitude install libgtk2.0-dev


Downloaded latest version and installed fbpanel locally:
    ./configure --prefix=/home/esheldon/local
    make
    make install

The text config file is under ~/.dotfiles/fbpanel/default and you should
link it under ~/.config/fbpanel/


On updating ubuntu, xmonad also updated.  xmonad did not run, it instead spit
out this message:

    xmonad-i386-linux: getProcessStatus: does not exist

Turns out this required re-compiling the xmonad startup script stored in
~/.xmonad/xmonad-i386-linux but it wasn't auto-detected.  I had to remove it
and then xmonad would re-compile and run fine.

full screen mplayer
-----------------------------------

# It won't go full screen unless you give -fstype none
mplayer -fstype none filename

# It will still have red boundary though.  We want to use smartBorders
# to fix that.

    import XMonad
    import XMonad.Layout.NoBorders
 
    main = xmonad $ 
            defaultConfig
                { layoutHook = smartBorders $ layoutHook defaultConfig
                -- other fields like terminal, modMask, etc.
                }

My actual layoutHook:

		layoutHook = avoidStruts $ smartBorders $ layoutHook defaultConfig,
