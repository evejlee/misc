Quick look Queue
    - Call BAB radiology to reschedule if possible. If not, talk to Andres.
    - Read through Eric's paper again, write down notes and Qs.
    - Start getting multi-epoch stuff working with hdfs.  Note the SE
      input files will have to point to hdfs too.
    - Default to fs='hdfs'?
    - hang out to see if Eric shows up in early evening?
    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.

    RedMapper
        - get first redmapper catalog
        - apply 1Mpc cuts; need to do this for randoms too... ugly. 
        - Look into new binning scheme on lambda.

    shears:
        - Match Frank's file
        - look at various local tests 
            - PSF tests need to be devised
            - <e> vs R
            - <e> vs psf e
            - <e> vs position, run, etc.
