zphot:

    Get some validation plots, good ones, 
    from carlos, or have him send me the data.

DES:

    Perform a new run with Mike's new improvements, and the new s/g stuff and
    file formats from Bob.

shears:

    Test with old princeton file:
        Note princeton file has r+i combined, which is a bit problematic,
        but we should at least see no bias.

        * Compare in pixel coordinates.
        * Compare my equatorial rotations to those in the file.

    Match Frank's file

        - check the skyserver sample queries
            - fix XXX in answers to practice. Need full db for that.
            - Check the orderby example when the full data are loaded,
                as it looks for pal 5 and needs runs not in test db
