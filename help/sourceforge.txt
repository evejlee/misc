shell access:
        access is through ssh keys.  I have my usual
        one uploaded, if it doesn't work you can
        do an update through the admin pages


        You might have to create a shell.
        ssh erinsheldon,sdssidl@shell.sourceforge.net create
        Then log in
        ssh erinsheldon,sdssidl@shell.sourceforge.net
        I set links to the web area, and the actual files are
        served from htdocs
