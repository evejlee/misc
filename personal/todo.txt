        - seeing b modes in the lensing at very large radius
            - source catalogs tried:
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > 1
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > sqrt(2)
        - going to try the maxlike version
            - photoz match is finished, need to make scat

        - could be psf: we know the sdss psf is anisotropic.  running
          EM without cocenter.
            - deal with finished gmix run (if it finished)
                - possibly implement em only psf
                - possibly replace admom with em 1 gauss?


          note: seeing a fair amount of admom failure in psf fitting.  maybe
          should use em there for single gauss to start?  Or skip altogether
          and just take psf_fwhm as a pretty good guess for overall size?

          Did make the guesses for admom slightly better....

        - meds
            - use 30 as zero point
            - bug in fitsio
                - beta "d" has fix but can't install
            - there is a bug writing string fields to meds, or at least
            how python fitsio shows them (that's it probably).

            - new low-thresh coadd catalogs take too long, cutting some fields
            - move blacklist code into deswl

        - cfitsio globally as cfitsio-des?
        - CCfits globally as ccfits-des
        - can get web access for files: access for apache but not other
          groups.
        - hopper much faster to global scratch
        - back up our data (meds) figure out tape archival needs.  Ask for
          more through salman.

        usage
        - prjquota des

    redmapper
        - add/modify entries to eduardo's null test etc. document

    bafit
        
        - c code
            - figure out if s/n is coming out correctly; s/n on flux is only
              about 3 for an s/n=100 object!
            - make a python code to write out the input file.
            - instead generate the data totally inside?  Would mean being able
              to draw from lognormal (easy I think) and from the shape prior.


        - see constant bias at low s/n.  Bug?
            - try g prior after?
            - try in eta space?

        - Importance sampling: to a maxlike fit and then importance
        sample at twice width or something.  What about size? lognormal?
        flux?

        - Gary thinks we have to use *correct* priors.  Try gaussian center,
          lognormal T, normal g, lognormal flux.
            - center will have to go into the convolved image code.


    LM fitting simple
        - Center currently always set to zero with no randomness!
        - required inputs are image, weight (or ivar), and psf (or list)
        - *optional* jacob
        - optional guesses
            - cen
            - T
            - counts
            - g1,g2
        - optional priors
            - cen
            - T
            - counts
            - g1,g2
           
        - starting guesses
            - one of the two above must be present
                - if the guess is present, always use it
                - otherwise draw from the prior

        - OR...
            - always require priors to be sent.  The trick there is if we want
              a flat prior we need to have a bound on it, and also drawing
              from it could result in crazy starting values
        - OR...
            - always require guesses, but these could be the expectation value
              of the prior.

    isampler fitting
        - deal when all prior zero

        - check covar but fixing it didn't work.  I was just returning error
          (defres).  What to do, restart fit?

        - same as above used for the initial ML fit.
        - then draw from the fits
            - cen draw from normal*prior
            - draw g1,g2 from normal*prior.
            - T
                - if T > 0, draw from lognormal*prior.
                - if T <= 0, draw from normal*prior
                - If prior sent, would expect it to be positive only.

            - counts from normal*prior?

    DES

        - redo colors in MEDS

            - try 1 gauss and 3 gauss for comparison
            - try alphawin_j2000 instead.  Might not help with bi-model thing
            seen, but perhaps the width and prior.

            - test max radius for various models?  This is in additioi to the
              5-sigma cutout for evaluating the gaussians.  I suspect we can
              shave off even more time.  Would have to define elliptial
              contour.

            - mcmc
                - look into trimming, but based on what size measure?
                - start guess for flux from psf flux?
                - don't use lmfit as name :)

            - flux is biased high at low S/N.  Looks to be more biased than
              the shear!  
              
                - Would it be improved by using prior during?
                    - running now geg01r06
                - prior on T?  How would we get one?
                    - need to run

            - porting mcmc to run with multi-epoch or regular
                - fix up calc_stats (can copy from lmfit stuff)

            - also need to perhaps run em if it is more stable than admom?  or
              at least catch the error and try again.

            - maybe supress fpack weight zeros noise?  Currently forcing 0 but
              could also set zero if simply much smaller than the median?

            - cases where match_model=='nil': psf fitting failing altogether?

            - make sure to port over prior fixes to cluster step

            - s2n with in 1.5'' aperture; how to do that?
                - add a parameter that is maxrad to likelihood code
                - new function to do weight s/n that takes a max rad can be
                  slower since it only needs be called once at the end.

            - fix centroids in fits (other than matched)?
            - throw out cutouts that hit too much edge?


        - gmix
            - shapelets psf image generation code
            - gary's alternative bayesian formulation
        - get outlier pixel rejection, features etc. from Daniel
            * sent email to daniel
        - convert coadd to wget as well

        - Daniel says weight map might have wrong normalization

        - eyeballing
            - framework from Tim
                * sent mail to Tim
            - triggers, e.g. users table with counters on how many images
              examined.

    ideas
        - my stack images but going to Fourier space (Gary)
        - shear response by deconvolving PSF, shear,
          then reconv. with slightly larger PSF (Eric)

    wlpipe

        - Finish Convert shapelets to new script stuff. Need module use from
          mike

    MEDS
        
        - make some metadata not string, if they exist

        In api, generate some useful filenames automatically,
            e.g. psfex file, fitpsf.
        Write integer metadata.

    gsim
        - pad against largest dimension instead of average
        - generate psf on a grid but at different sub-pixel locations


    recfile
    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  See Rachel's stuff.

        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only


    - sobjshear hadoop
        - need concatenation of lens outputs when we did lens splits.  to be
          done during reduce or before?
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?

    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run

    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - refactor images/tables

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.
