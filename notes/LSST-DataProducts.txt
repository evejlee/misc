Overall
    
    - How do you define S/N generally?  I see a few places where it is some
      kind of PSF flux but it is not everywhere clear.  I see a footnote 54,
      but I'm not sure if that is the same S/N referred to at other times.


    - Much of the level thee, as described in the document, is a software
      *framework* or *service* rather than a data product.    What users will
      need at level 3 is primarily a data product.  For many use cases, such
      as using existing catalogs, processing SE images and Coadds, what you
      have described seems sufficient to me.

      However, sophisticated end users, and developers of new algorithms, will
      primarily want to work with multi-epoch data, either in a multi-fit type
      approach or time-domain.  This argues for a data *product* that makes
      such analysis simple and efficient.  This is opposed to a software
      framework, which will impose unnecessary restrictions.

      I can give an anedote from DES:  We have defined a data product that is
      a single multi-extension FITS file for each coadd tile that contains
      cutouts at the location of coadd Objects from each single epoch image
      associated with the coadd (Multi-Epoch Data Structure MEDS).  This makes
      it very simple for anyone to write a code to process in a multi-fit
      mode, and it is efficient as well.
        

    - I think level 3 should be seen as nearly as important as level 2.  From
      my experience with SDSS and DES, much of the cutting edge will come as
      what you call level 3.  For example, it is not at all clear that lensing
      will be a solved problem at the time of LSST first light, and research
      in this area will greatly benefit from local access to the LSST data.

        Bullet 1

            Spell out DIA as Difference Image Analysis here.

        Bullet 2
            
            You say "detected on deep coadds as well as individual visits" I
            think you mean detected on coadds *or* individual visits.  There
            will be detections on both coadds and SE visits as well as only
            coadd or SE visits.
        
        There are, I think, missing categories here:  
        
            - multi-fit measurements.
              ** I see you do discuss this in section 5.1/5.2 but not here.

            - Some data product that facilitates straightforward processing of
              the multi-epoch data (e.g. to produce my bullet above).  

              ** I see you mention multifit in section 5.1/5.2, but without
              mention of a data product to facilitate that outside the primary
              processing. 

        Footnote 4  I predict your use of the word Source will result in
        confusion.

    4.1

        How do you define "apparition"?

        Footnote 15

            An anectdote : in DES we find it useful to make cutouts variable
            in size according to objects size, and then rounding up to 2^N or
            3*2^N for optimal FFT processing.  I understand for transient
            alerts one would probably produce a small, fixed size cutout.

    4.2.2

        The tables are being updated daily.  Do you plan to have some way to
        recover the previous states of these tables?

5.1

    How much of this deblender has been implemented?

5.2

    bulge-disk would be 12 free parameters if unconstrained, not 18.  If you
    fix the centers and ellipticities to be equal, then the number of
    parameters drops to 8. (row,col,e1,e2,scale1,scale2,flux1,flux2)

    I see that you list 8 parameters in Table 4, so 18 must have been a typo.


    photoZ "...widely accepted algorithm..." ha!

5.5

    Footnote 85

        I'm surprised that coadds are a driver for storage; I would expect the
        SE images to completely dominate, by a factor of ~ number of
        snapshots.

5.6 Open Issues

        - What about sky subtraction?  I think you must be optimizing for
          faint object photometry, but this was not stated.
          
          This pertains to the question of large galaxy characterization;
          level 3 analysis may well need different sky characterization.
