some one-syllable offsets on chord changes are intentional



Intro strumming G


                D                     G
Don't sing love songs; you'll wake my mother,
               D                 Em 
She's sleeping here, right by my side.
                 C              Am
And in her right hand, a silver dagger.
              Em      C       D
She says that I can't be your bride.


            D              G
All men are false, says my mother,
                     D          Em
They'll tell you wicked, lovin' lies.
                  C                       Am
And the very next evening, they'll court another,
           Em      C        D
Leave you alone to pine and sigh.


         D               G
My daddy he's a handsome devil
           D                Em
He's got a chain five miles long,
           C                   Am
And on every link a heart does dangle
           Em        C         D
Of another maid he's loved and wronged.


          D             G
So court another tender maiden,
              D                Em
And hope that she will be your wife,
         C                     Am
For I've been warned, and I've decided
          Em       C     D
To sleep alone all of my life.
