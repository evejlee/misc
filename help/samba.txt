On lucid

    sudo aptitude install samba smbfs

edit 
    /etc/samba/smb.conf 

and make sure it uses this to demand samba users also have unix accounts
    security = user

then I only allowed looking at the shared area (note the name [shared] can be anything)

[share]
    comment = An area shared for all users
    path = /home/share

    writeable = yes

    create mask = 0600

    directory mode = 0700

    locking = yes

Made the directory:

    mkdir -p /home/share
    chmod -R a+rxw /home/share

Added a user:
    sudo adduser guest

And added the samba user corresponding to this new user. Note we demanded
that the samba user also had a unix account above:

    sudo smbpasswd  -a guest

Then restart samba:

    sudo service smbd restar


Now to auto-mount this in OS X:
    First go to Go->connect to server

        add smb://192.168.127.104/share
    (or whatever) and put in guest and the password, save to keychain.

    *If* it shows up on the desktop, all you have to do is then go to
    your login items and drag it onto there. It will get mounted when
    you log in.

    Remember to tell sarah that address will only work on the local network!
