This is a way to install Python with NumPy, the numerical python package, and
SciPy, as set of routines to do scientific analysis with python. Plotting is
also supported by the matplotlib packages. The packages below are the minimal
you need to install.

Everything just works which is why I prefer the MacPython distro to others.
The problem is that you don't necessarily get the latest greatest you could get
with the svn checkout, but it may be possible to use svn as well.  I haven't
yet tried.


TeX
-------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you have tex installed, so you can make figures with labels and
symbols created using tex. And so you can write papers of course.

Xcode
-------------------------------------------------------
This comes for free with OS X since at least tiger, probably before. Check
your install disk. 



MacPython
--------------------------------------------------------
Main homepage:
  http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/
Package download for python 2.4:
  http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/

Packages I installed from http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/:
  Package    Version   Description
  --------------------------------
  python     2.4.3     Probably newer than what you have by default. 
  numpy      1.0b5     NumPy See http://scipy.org/ and http://numpy.scipy.org/
  matplotlib 0.87.5    Plotting - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  scipy      0.5.1     http://scipy.org/

  Optional but perhaps useful. 
  wxPython   2.6       For a different GUI than TK.  I have yet to see 
                       advantages to this over TK.

Getting it working
-----------------------------------

PATH
  You will need to have this in your path for executables:
    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python
  Note one of the install scripts modifies your shell startup file to
  do this but messes up the syntax (this is the one bug I have found)
  so you need to do this yourself.

NUMERIX

  You should set an environment variable
    setenv NUMERIX numpy
  This is used by some packages that are currently moving from the older
  numerical packages (numarray,numeric) to distinguish your preference. In
  the future the default will be numpy but do this for now just in case.

PLOTTING
  To get plotting to work you should create a file in a new directory
    .matplotlib/matplotlibrc
  And add the following at minimum:

  backend      : TkAgg  # If you installed wxPython you can leave this off or set to WxAgg
  numerix      : numpy  # numpy, Numeric or numarray
  text.usetex  : True   # use latex for all text handling.  For more information, see
                        # http://www.scipy.org/Wiki/Cookbook/Matplotlib/UsingTex
    
  You can get see full set of options by looking at this file:
    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc
  The tex is especially nice.  See here for example usage
  of tex: 
    http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/UsingTex


Some additional packages
-------------------------------

pyfits: Pure python FITS reader that uses numpy.
  http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits
  
  To install: sudo python setup.py install
