Abstract:

    The wording sounds like the lensing mass measurements were performed in this
    paper.  

Intro

    P2 Typo? "...models of galaxy and hot gas evolution in *halo* will..." probably
    should be halos, unless your research is funded by Bungee

    P4 "...provide a weaker *constrain*..." should be constraint.

S2.1

    P1 "...cluster sample we employ..."  You can't employ inanimate objects :-P

    P2 You say the photozs are *accurate* but then quote a precision \Delta_z.
    The accuracy is I believe around 0.01

S2.2

    P2 This paragraph is a little opaque.  I think the reason you have to pick
    z=0.25 is because you can't k-correct each photon or something, right, not
    "for consistency with lensing" which enforces no such choice. 
    
    P3  \rho_{gas} is not used anywhere else, might as well just say
    "Since Lx is proportional to the gas density squared"

S2.3

    P1 We don't average the tangential shear, we average \Delta\Sigma.  This is
    not a fine point, it is important.  You can say perhaps: "The mean
    projected surface density contrast, measured from the shear of background
    galaxies, " or something like that.

S3
    
    P1 "Fig. 1 plots..." a figure cannot plot anything.  Maybe "In Figure 1 we
    plot..." or "In Figure 1 we show" or whatever.

    Some 9% of the mass uncertainties are systematic, which must be included in
    a special way in fits. How did you propagate the systematic component? 

    P2  "statistically significantly"  is awkward, maybe just significantly?
    Also I would split the sentence for the different comparisons.

Figure 1

    Do you need to show the error size in the legend?  The points do have error
    bars in the mass direction.

S4


    P1  you have an extraneous comma after "detailed"

    P4  Need another comma after \sigma_{lnM...}
    
    P9 "..covariance can both tilt the scaling relation and modify the scatter"


General
    A similar covariance is expected for M200-N200 yes?

    For some reason there is extra space between paragraphs on page 4, column 1.
