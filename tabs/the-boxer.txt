C                              Em/B           Am
I am just a poor boy though my story’s seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7             G                 C
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
              Am            G                 F
All lies and jests, still a man hears what he wants to hear
                          C    
And disregards the rest hmhmhmhmhm
        G              F       Em     C
                                         Em/B           Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
       G
In the company of strangers
       G7         G                C
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Am           G              F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                        C
Where the ragged people go
        G              F    G          C
Looking for the places only they would know

       Am          G                       Am
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie
       F            G                C
Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la lie.

                                   Em/B          Am
Asking only workman’s wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
       G7               G                  C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh’ Avenue
     Am                  G              F
I do declare, there were times I was so lonesome
                         C
that I took some comfort there
      G        F Em C    G7     G7 G6 C
La la la la la Interlude

       Am          G                       Am
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie
       F            G                C
Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la lie.


                                          Em/B          Am
Then I’m laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
      G                 G7                           C
Going home….. where the New York City winters aren’t bleeding me
        Em   Am           G ? G F Em C       C
Leading me, ohhh... going home
                                       Em/B           Am
In the clearing stands the boxer and a fighter by his trade
       G                     G7                                C
And he carries a reminder of ev’ry glove that laid him down or Cut him till he cried out
       Am                       G             F
in his anger and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving

                      C
But the fighter still remains

       Am          G                       Am
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie
       F            G                Am
Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la lie.
       Am          G                       Am
Lie la lie, lie la la la la la lie, lie la lie
       F            G                C
Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la lie.
