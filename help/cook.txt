shell loin steak
-----------------

Started out with two chimneys, but couldn't get temp over 160 (probably 200 on
my grill?) After ~hour I added more and it got to 180.  Kept it there for total
of 2.5 hours.  Meat was 140 when I checked, and ended up being slightly over
medium.  Probably should have checked a bit earlier, since at 2 hours meat was
at 120.

Get digital thermometer and meat thermometer!!!

The marinade had too much vinigar for me; vinegar in the balsamic and the
worshesteshire .  I would prefer something a bit more subtle.
