beef loin shell steak
---------------------

Started out with two chimneys, but couldn't get temp over 160 (probably 200 on
my grill?) After ~hour I added more and it got to 180.  Kept it there for rest
of the time.  Total time of 2.5 hours.  Meat was 140 when I checked, and ended
up being slightly over medium.  Probably should have checked a bit earlier,
since at 2 hours meat was at 120.

I put two boxes of apple wood chips on; the first near the beginning and the
second when I added another chimney.  It did better off to the side; when
placed on the coals it was spent quickly. This was *plenty* of smoking.

** Get a digital thermometer and meat thermometer!!! **

The marinade had too much vinigar for me; vinegar in the balsamic and the
worshesteshire .  I would prefer something a bit more subtle, but not sure what
to change.  The soy sauce seems like a good idea still.

    3 parts olive oil
    1 part balsamic
    < 1 part worshesteshir 
    < 1 part soy sauce
    < 1 part minced carlic
    forgot the mustard completely.
    lots of black pepper
    some ceyanne
    little bit onion powder
