A procedure called get_atlas is now available.  You give it a photo structure
and the index of an object in that structure.  It returns an image that
contains the 5 atlas images associated with that object (5 colors).

IDL> get_atlas
Syntax - get_atlas, struct, index, im, dir=dir, field=field, run=run, 
camcol=camcol, maxsize=maxsize, display=display
maxsize = [maxrow,maxcol].    No display if display=1

im is the returned image.  If you use read_photo_col to get struct, then 
field, run, and camcol are in struct and need not be supplied.
maxsize is the maximum size that each atlas subimage can be.  The default 
is [500,500].  The picture is displayed to you unless you set display=1

dir is the directory of the atlas image.  If you start idl in the atlas 
directory, dir is unnecessary.  

example: get the 25th object from struct.  Using stars file is quick.
