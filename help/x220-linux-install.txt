I first tried arch linux, but udev could not find my ethernet card.

So, ubuntu it is.

For ubuntu, can use usb-creator to make a bootable usb for installation.
I tried Lubuntu 11

The install fails if I try using the usb port on the back left.  It succeeds
using the front left.


After install, easiest way to get started us using the stuff on the eeebuntu
3.0 labeled usb stick (relabel it!).  get the id_rsa* stuff off there and put
it in ~/.ssh.  Then install 
    ssh-askpass
    keychain 
    
and you should be good to go.  There is a version of mysetup.sh on there. If it is out of date, just get it from the webfactional account.

Note I could not get Xmodmap or Xdefaults to work under lxde. Need to look into
it.


XSession
--------
couldn't figure out how to get lxdm to recognize my xsession.

going to try skipping right to a text login

in grub 2.0 you edit kernel mode lines by editing
    /etc/default/grub

I removed 
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
and replaced it with
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"

Note if you leave it blank, it prints all the info still, but
then brings up the display manager.

Then ran
    sudo update-grub

That worked.



Now, couple of problems:
    the xmodmap load was not working
        Had to change it to this

            remove Lock = Caps_Lock
            keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
            add Control = Control_L

    fbpanel doesn't look right
        no transparency or something. Don't
        understand why it looks ok on my other
        installs

    nm-applet not working, some kind of permissions problem
    trying this:

        /etc/dbus-1/system.d/NetworkManager.conf
