C               C          C                C
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
         C                C        G       G 
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
G                G         G                G 
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
     G               G             C 
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

  C             C             C             C
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
    C                   C7              F    F
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
F                   F                 C                C
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
G              G                G    G 
We sang every song that driver knew

F                F             C                 C
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
G                  G                           C    C
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
    F                F              C                 C
And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
         G                G                G   G7
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
G                G                C    C    D    D
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

         D         D                D          D
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
     D                 D          A       A 
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
        A             A               A              A 
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
     A          A                D     D
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold

    D              D            D                 D
One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
     D                 D7                 G        G
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
         G               G              D            D
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
      A                A            A    A 
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

G                G             D                 D
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
A                    A              D       D
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
      G                G          D                     D
Well, feelin' good was easy, lo-o-ord, when he sang the blues
    A                A                A   A(7?)
And feelin' good was good enough for me
A                A                D         D
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee yeah
