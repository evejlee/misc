Quick look Queue
    - Start getting multi-epoch stuff working with hdfs.  Note the SE
      input files will have to point to hdfs too.
    - ME check code, parallelized, with hdfs
    - ME collation code, parallelized, with hdfs
    - Default to fs='hdfs'?

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - s/g sep in BOSS catalog
    - stellar contamination for BOSS catalog

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

        - put in some centering now and produce a catalog
            - ready for proposals
            - let people know cat exists and we'll iterate on it
            - means slight punt on centering for v0.1
                - I argue don't publish quickly obsolete paper

        - chandra proposal?
        - redshifts for high-z SPT clusters

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.

    RedMapper
        - get first redmapper catalog
        - apply 1Mpc cuts; need to do this for randoms too... ugly. 
        - Look into new binning scheme on lambda.

    shears:
        - s/g sep
        - stellar contamination
        - Match Frank's file
        - look at various local tests 
            - PSF tests need to be devised
            - <e> vs R
            - <e> vs psf e
            - <e> vs position, run, etc.
