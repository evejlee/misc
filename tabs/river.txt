Dm/C is like F but move your third finger up a string

     Dm/C         C
It's coming on Christmas
        Dm/C           C
They're cutting down trees
        Dm/C         C
They're putting up reindeer
             Dm/C      C
And singing songs of joy and peace
     Am                           G
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

    Dm/C      C
But it don't snow here 
   Dm/C           C
It stays pretty green
             Dm/C            C
I'm gonna to make a lot of money
                  Dm/C         C
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
   Am                          G
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

     F                     G
Oh I wish I had a river so long
        C                 F Em Dm  
I would  teach my feet to fly
     C                  G                    F
Oh I wish I had a river  that I could skate away on
               C
I made my baby cry

Am..... G.....

    Dm/C               C
He tried hard to help me
             Dm/C        C
You know, he put me at ease
       Dm/C           C
And he loved me so naughty
        Dm/C   C
Made me weak in the knees
    Am
Oh I wish I had a river
          G
I could skate away on

    Dm/C         C
I'm so hard to handle
    Dm/C             C
I'm selfish and I'm sad
         Dm/C               C
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
Dm/C   C
That I ever had
     Am
Oh I wish I had a river
          G
I could skate away on

     F                     G
Oh I wish I had a river so long
        C                 F Em Dm  
I would  teach my feet to fly
     C                  G                    F
Oh I wish I had a river  that I could skate away on
                 C
I made my baby say goodbye

Am..... G.....

     Dm/C         C
It's coming on Christmas
        Dm/C           C
They're cutting down trees
        Dm/C         C
They're putting up reindeer
             Dm/C      C
And singing songs of joy and peace
     Am                           G
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
