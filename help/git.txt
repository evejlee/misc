If you create a local branch and you want to then create the remove branch
(e.g. on github) as a copy of the local one, do the following:

    git push origin bundle:refs/heads/bundle

Here origin means "where I got the original copy of this repo from" If that
gives an error like 

    error: src refspec origin does not match any.
    error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:esheldon/fitsio.git'

Then you might have to run a command like this

    git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/master
