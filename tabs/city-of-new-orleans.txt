G             D       G   
Riding on the City of New Orleans
Em               C              G    D
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
G                D                G   
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Em                   D                    G  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.

    Em                                 Bm 
All along the south bound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kenkakee
D                                 A   
Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Em                                Bm
Passing trains that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
    D             D7           G    
And graveyards of rusted automobiles.

C            D7           G      
Good morning America, how are ya?                                                       
     Em                 C               G    D7  
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
        G                   D           Em      A7    
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        F         C       D                     G    
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

        G                   D              G
Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Em                  C              G
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
G              D                  G
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Em              D                   G
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor

        Em                              Bm
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
           D                              A
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
Em                           Bm
Mother with her babes asleep rocking to the gentle beat
        D             D7                G
And the rhythm of the rail  is all they feel.

C            D7           G      
Good morning America, how are ya?                                                       
     Em                 C               G  D7  
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
        G                   D           Em         A7    
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        F         C       D                     G    
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

G                 D           G
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Em               C       G
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
G            D                 G
Halfway home we'll be there by morning
            Em                   D                   G
through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea.

    Em                               Bm
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
        D                                A
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
    Em                                   Bm
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain
     D                   D7              G
This train got the disappearing railroad blues.

C           D7          G
Good night America, how are you?
     Em                 C               G       D7  
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
        G                   D           Em   A7    
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        F         C       D                     G    
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
