shell loin steak
-----------------

Started out with two chimneys, but couldn't get temp over 160 (probably 200 on
my grill?) After ~hour I added more and it got to 180.  Kept it there for total
of 2.5 hours.  Meat was 140 when I checked, and ended up being slightly over
medium.  Probably should have checked a bit earlier, since at 2 hours meat was
at 120.

Get digital thermometer and meat thermometer!!!

The marinade had too much vinigar for me; vinegar in the balsamic and the
worshesteshire .  I would prefer something a bit more subtle, but not sure what
to change.  The soy sauce seems like a good idea still.

    3 parts olive oil
    1 part balsamic
    < 1 part worshesteshir (I cut it a bit)
    < 1 part soy sauce
    forgot the mustard completely.
    lots of black pepper
    some ceyanne
    little bit onion powder
