ITS NOT C7, it is a C with the base note and the c flatted.

VERSE:
G                 C7
Mary Anne, do you remember
                Am7
the tree by the river
             G
when we were seventeen?

(same)
Dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
and the mare in the pasture
pitch black and baring its teeth.

(same)
I recall the sun in our faces,
stuck and leaning on braces,
and being strangers to change.

(same)
Radio and the bones we found frozen,
and all the thorns and the roses
beneath your window pane.

CHORUS:
Am7                 G
Now I'm asleep in a car, I mean the world
     Am7
to a potty-mouth girl,
                           G
a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds.

(same)
Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say.
But I wonder to who(m) and
what it is you're saying today.

SOLO: G|C7|Am7 (same as verse)

CHORUS: (same as above)
Now I'm asleep in a car, I mean the world
to a potty-mouth girl,
a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds.

Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say.
But I wonder to who(m) and
what it is you're saying today.

VERSE: (same as above)
Mary Anne, do you remember
the tree by the river
when we were seventeen?

Dark canyon road, I was coy in the half-moon;
happy just to be with you,
and you were happy for me.
