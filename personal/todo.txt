    - memory leak in fitsio

    - make combined mask starting with "good", excluding star, good excluding
      badfield or whatever is appropriate.

    pymangle
    - don't allow not snapped masks
    - good mask is snapped, but doesn't say it because write_mangle_polygons
      didn't write it

    recfile
    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears
        - re-run create input with detrends
        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - how to correct the trends?  By camcol or on run basis?
        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  Estimate contamination?

    - catalog for peter
    - sobjshear
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?
        - would like to know *effective* p(z) for the sources used, in weighted
          sense.  Difficult because we don't actually have p(z) only the sigma
          crit as a function of zlens.

    - get wood delivered
    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run (sample s06)

    - new redmapper. stack multiple centers
    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Default to fs='hdfs'?

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.

        - s/g sep
        - stellar contamination
        - Match Frank's file
        - look at various local tests 
            - PSF tests need to be devised
            - <e> vs R
            - <e> vs psf e
            - <e> vs position, run, etc.
