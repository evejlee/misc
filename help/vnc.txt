The server:
----------------------------------------------

Start the server, simple:

	vncserver

It will tell you what display it is using, probably 1 if you are not running
others.

You can set the geometry:

	vncserver -geometry 1282x1024 -depth 24

To stop the server:

	vncserver -kill :1

The server number is used here.


Running a client.
----------------------------------------------

Set up a tunnel, actually a double tunnel.  Say you will be running the server
on lsst19, then the port is 590 followed by the display number. 

	ssh -t -L 5901:localhost:17654 rssh.rhic.bnl.gov "ssh -L 17654:localhost:5901 lsst19.lst.bnl.gov"

If display were 3 it would be 5903

Now to connect.  Ubuntu comes with a viewer called vinagre:

	vinagre: localhost:1

If display were3, it would be localhost:3 If you install one of the other vnc
viewere, it will probably name itselv vncviewer

	vncviewer localhost:1



* I can't get the clipboard to work copying into VNC only out.

* I can't get my Xmodmap key bindings to hold.  Even runnig
   Xmodmap inside the session didn't work.  this was true for vinagre and all
   the other clients I tried.

* screen gets confused thinking being in VNC that the current
  shell is actually inside a screen session. running screen
  will actually open a new window in an existing screen session!

  You can overcome this using
	      screen -m


Some configuration:
----------------------------------------------

On the server, in ~/.vnc there is an xstartup file.  You can put your window
manager of choice in there.  Might want to change twm to mwm for example.


How to get clipboard working?



Which client to install?
----------------------------------------------

I tried the java tightvnc but it kept stealing my tab keys.

I then installed xtightvncviewer, also tight but not using
the java wrapper.  Doesnt' steal the tab key but clipboard
doesn't seem to work: I can copy from the vnc out but
not in.
