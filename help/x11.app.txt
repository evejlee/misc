Focus follows mouse:
    defaults write org.x.X11 wm_ffm -bool true 

Don't start the stupid xterm, just run something that does
nothing
    defaults write org.x.X11_launcher app_to_run /usr/X11/bin/xprop
And to make it start xterm again
    defaults write org.x.X11_launcher app_to_run /usr/X11/bin/xterm
