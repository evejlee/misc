# to use alternate server and file
tin -r -f newsrcfile -g server

# to start fast -Q

#e.g.
tin -r -f .chcgil_newsrc -g reader0-chcgil.newsops.execpc.com

# to save all to disk and mark read
tin -r -S -c -f .tmp_newsrc

#probably should use a different .newsrc file so can read 
# later fill .tmp_newsrc with the groups you want to save
# locally. Then read with the following:

tin -R -f .localnewsrc

# which just contains usegroups in .tmp_newsrc, but they aren't
# marked read yet

# when you have read everything you can delete the files

#maybe put the -S command in a cron job every few hours. for the one
# i'm thinking about, perhaps every few days!
