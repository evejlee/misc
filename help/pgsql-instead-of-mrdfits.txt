Using mrdfits/mwrfits:
--------------------------

# Write some data
mwrfits, struct, file, /create
# Read the data
t = mrdfits(file, 1)

# extract some objects based on properties
w=where(t.x gt 3 and t.y lt 25)

# but if file is huge you can't do it
# in a simple way


Using postgres
--------------------------

# Write some data
pg=obj_new('postgres')
pg->struct2table, struct, 'test_table'

# Read some data
t = pg->query('select * from test_table')


# extract some objects based on properties
# Either grab all and select from it in the
# standard way:
w=where(t.x gt 3 and t.y lt 25)

# or just grab the subset directly from the db
# useful when the table is too big for memory

t=pg->query('select * from test_table where x > 3 and y < 25')
