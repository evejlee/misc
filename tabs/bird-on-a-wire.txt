Bird on a Wire, Leonard Cohen

This fits in my voice better than others I have found. The G-Gsus4-G pattern is
an optional ornament and can be improvised.
                                -ESS

       G           D            G                   C
Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
       G           D         G-Gsus4-G
I have tried in my way to be free
       G         D            G                              C
Like a worm on a hook, like a knight from some old-fashioned book
       G            D           G-Gsus4-G
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

       C                   G-Gsus4-G
    If I, if I have been unkind
      Am                               G  
    I hope that you can just let it go by
       C                   G-Gsus4-G
    If I, if I have been untrue,
      Am                            D
    I hope you know it was never to you.

        G        D            G              C
Like a baby stillborn, like a beast with his horn
       G         D                       G-Gsus4-G
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
      G             D           G                    C
But I swear by this song and by all that I have done wrong
     G      D                 G   
That I will make it all up to thee.

      C                                  G
    I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
       Am                                   G
    He said to me, "You must not ask for so much."
          C                                    G 
    And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
        Am                                 D
    She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"

       G           D            G                   C 
Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
       G           D         C    G
I have tried in my way to be free
