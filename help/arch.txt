Working on treebeard.

Dual booting

windows is on sda
install on sdb


All should work pretty easily.

remember, you *do* want to install grub on the MBR of sda!

Now it will write the wrong /boot/grub/menu.lst and you'll have to
rename on first boot

    vmlinuz26               becomes     vmlinuz-linux
    kernel26.img            becomes     initramfs-linux.img
    kernel26-fallback.img   becomes     initramfs-linux-fallback.img
