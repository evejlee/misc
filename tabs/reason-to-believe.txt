If I listened long enough to you

I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
A                D             C             G
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
        Em             C         D
Still I look to find a reason to believe

             C            D             Em                D        
Someone like you makes it easy to give    and never think about myself

If I gave you time to change my mind

I'd try to leave all the past behind
A                D             C             G
