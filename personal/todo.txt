        - seeing b modes in the lensing at very large radius
            - source catalogs tried:
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > 1
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > sqrt(2)
        - going to try the maxlike version
            - photoz match is finished, need to make scat

        - could be psf: we know the sdss psf is anisotropic.  running
          EM without cocenter.
            - deal with finished gmix run (if it finished)
                - possibly implement em only psf
                - possibly replace admom with em 1 gauss?


          note: seeing a fair amount of admom failure in psf fitting.  maybe
          should use em there for single gauss to start?  Or skip altogether
          and just take psf_fwhm as a pretty good guess for overall size?

          Did make the guesses for admom slightly better....

        - cfitsio globally as cfitsio-des?
        - CCfits globally as ccfits-des
        - can get web access for files: access for apache but not other
          groups.
        - hopper much faster to global scratch
        - back up our data (meds) figure out tape archival needs.  Ask for
          more through salman.

        - redo colors in MEDS

            - got jacobian working right, as well as the P*J as it can predict
              a small sheared population.
            - next generate some shapes from the prior, shear them, and use
              the P,Q,J values to recover the shear.  Should be easy!

            - added new jacob/prior BA stuff, merged to refactor1 branch
              going to work on refactor branch from here on out

            - jacobian is unit at g=0 no matter what, and derivative is zero
            making Q zero.  What's the deal?

            - failing on variable length column?

                Pence says it is a need to use 64-bit integers.  He will fix.

            - MEDS are going to take a lot longer!  trying 24 hours

            - make sure data type changes in MakeCutouts don't cause a problem
              in meds.c; also check metadata reading (do I do that?)
            - new calibrations and coadds.  Running new meds files for i band.

            - tests suggest that restricting to seg map can cause aperture
              effects on the size.  For stars I used a fixed aperture and all
              pixels not associated with *another* object. This produced good
              results.  The get_cweight* we should just zero the pixels
              from other objects.

            - did a test gfme001zt but it used faked seg maps.  It ran though!
              
            - ! need coadd seg maps !  Robert forgot to start them do full
              meds run 006 for z of eli's chosen tile when we get them
              (DES0512-6205)

            - new coadds (and calibrations?) should show up next week.

            - consolidate codes.  The ones that don't use a jacobian can call
              the ones that do with a identity matrix jacob and row0,col0 zero

            - s2n with in 1.5'' aperture; how to do that?
                - add a parameter that is maxrad to likelihood code
                - new function to do weight s/n that takes a max rad can be
                  slower since it only needs be called once at the end.

            - fix centroids in fits (other than matched)?
            - throw out cutouts that hit too much edge?

            - need to possibly store the psf fits in a separate file or
              extension.

            - aperture corrections on psfflux: put back difference from model
              and psf image

                    flux = flux*(1+(model-psfimage)/psfimage)

                how to do on stack?  average that frac diff?

            - bulge+disk?
                - coelliptical would add two parameters

                    [cen1,cen2,e1,e2,T1,T2,p1,p2]

                and we are back to similar situation as coelliptical
                gaussians, which just don't work that well.  bdco

            - when gauss is psf, 2 won't fit well; might want fallback to 1
              gauss.

              examined.

    ideas
        - my stack images but going to Fourier space (Gary)
        - shear response by deconvolving PSF, shear,
          then reconv. with slightly larger PSF (Eric)

        - make some metadata not string, if they exist

        In api, generate some useful filenames automatically,
            e.g. psfex file, fitpsf.
        Write integer metadata.

    gsim
        - pad against largest dimension instead of average
        - generate psf on a grid but at different sub-pixel locations

    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  See Rachel's stuff.

        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only


    - sobjshear hadoop
        - need concatenation of lens outputs when we did lens splits.  to be
          done during reduce or before?
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?

    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run

    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - refactor images/tables

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.
