Trying preemptive strike on 
  tetex which has binary 3.0-1001 (latest 3.0-1002)
  worked

  also gtk+2 etc. no good, binary is too old.
  I'm just going to do the rest, let it run all night.


?Why are they all compiling? I used -b.  Maybe try apt-get.

The first thing is to make sure you are using the latest version of fink (0.8.1
or later).  I found I was still using 10.4-transitional, which cannot update
itself.  This is because of a switch from using gcc3 to gcc4.  Sadly, the best
solution is to move /sw to /sw.bak, install the latest fink, and reinstall
all your packages.

Usual blurb about installing Xcode.
-----------------------------------
This contains gcc and the blas/atlas/lapack stuff.

Unstable branch
---------------------------------
numpy et al. are in the unstable branch, despite being
more stable than many packages in the stable branch. 
The easiest way to use the unstable branch is to go through
the fink-commander (the gui front end) preferences menu.
Once you enable that you can see scipy

NumPy: fink install scipy-core-py24
---------------------------------
In fink, numpy is still known as scipy-core.  This will isntall like 20 other
packages if you are starting from scratch. Most of these will have to
be compiled so it could take a while.

This works fine.

SciPy: fink install scipy-py24
--------------------------------
This will automatically install numpy (scipy-core-py24)
And also some other needed items such as netcdf, fftw3,
g95 (ouch!). This actually only took a couple of hours for everything.


IPython: fink install ipython-py24
-----------------------------------
No problems.

Matplotlib: fink install matplotlib-py24
------------------------------------------
This has a huge number of dependencies!
tetex, ghostscript (and fonts), atk, autoconf, automake
docbook, expat, freetype, gd2, gettext, glib, glib2,
gtk+2, html-tagset-pm, intltool, glade2, libjpeg,
kpathsea4, libpng3, libtiff, libwww, libtool, libxml,
libxslt, numarray (already have?), numeric, openjade,
openmotif, opensp4, pango, pkgconfig, pygtk2, sgml, 
tlib, xdg, m4


Got a complaint during gettext install: Fink isn't sure how to install the
above packages safely. You may be able to fix things by running:

  fink scanpackages
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install gettext-dev=0.10.40-25 gettext=0.10.40-25

I did this and things are running again.
