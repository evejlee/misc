zphot:

    Get some validation plots, good ones, 
    from carlos, or have him send me the data.

shears:

    Test with old princeton file:
        Note princeton file has r+i combined, which is a bit problematic,
        but we should at least see no bias.

        * Compare in pixel coordinates.
        * Compare my equatorial rotations to those in the file.

    Match Frank's file
