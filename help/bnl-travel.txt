DES Collaboraton Meeting at Stanford.

	winnie had me contact travel.  They asked for a travel # but I found out
	from winnie that she won't have that till it gets approved.  I don't
	understand which should happen first, but the travel people sent the
	info to winnie and then she will work for it to get approved.

	Anyway, they were very helpful, with both flights and hotels.

	Registration I did myself with a credit card and just forwarded winnie the
	email receipt.
