This is the adaptive moment atlas image pipeline.  It makes use of a modified
version of Robert Luptons atlas image reader, and the adaptive moment code,
both written in C.  The wrapper admomatlas is also written in C.

Also included are two programs designed to be linked into idl. The first is
admom.c, which takes in an image and object positions and measures the moments
of each object.  The second is specifically designed for processing the
reconstructed PSF and it is called psfadmom.c  After running make admom.so and
psfadmom.so are created and copied to the bin directory.

Installation
----------------

I've written make files for linux, irix, OSF/1 (digital unix).
To compile:

make linux (or irix or osf)
make

Let me know if there are any compile problems.

Running the code
----------------
There is an example input file in the test/ directory. You need
to use that format (see the code for what each column is)

You also need to know where the atlas images are.  If your cwd isn't
that directory, you will have to send it

Usage:
$ admomatlas
Usage: bin/admomatlas inputfile outputfile [atlas_dir]

Example:
$ bin/admomatlas test/admomin-000752-1-1-0011-0011.dat test/admomout-000752-1-1-0011-0011.dat /sdss3/data1/imaging/752/objcs/1

Linking admom.so into idl
---------------------------

;; These variables must all be declared ahead of time

tmp = call_external(value = [0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,$
                             0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B,0B],$
                    bindir+'admom.so','admom', $
                    image,$ 
                    nrow, ncol,$
