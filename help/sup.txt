Configuration
---------------------------------
The highlight line is not configurable!!

Edited the code ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/sup-0.11/lib/sup/colormap.rb
so the highlight_for now just always returns [green,black,[]]

getmail
----------------------------
I installed getmail and put config in ~/.getmail/getmailrc.  There
is a version of the config file in the svn repo with the password
removed

msmtp
---------------------------------------------
I installed msmtp and added it to config of sup and made ~/.msmtprc
I configured editor.  Also a version in svn with password removed.


cron
-------------------------------------
made cron job to run getmail. It is in ~/svn/cron/crontab.treebeard


printing mail
----------------------------------------

Installed muttprint and w3m,w3m-img for printing emails (note it installed tex)
I also wrote ~/python/bin/mprint (modified from a python script found on the
sup site) to create a postscript version of a mail.


date searches
-----------------------------
Installed chronic for date searches
    gem install chronic
But doesn't seem to be working


Installation of sup
------------------------------------------
See the help for gems first

aptitude install 
    rubygems
aptitude install 
    uuid-dev ruby-dev ncurses-dev libxapian libxapian-dev libopenssl-ruby
    zlib1g-dev

Pre-install rake
    gem install rake

To prepare for ncursesw
    aptitude install libncursesw5-dev
    gem install ncursesw
Seems to work well in gnome terminal but not mrxvt


also you'll need this to run:
  


on os x

from brew Iinstalled msmtp, getmail, chronic.  Then from looking at the deb I saw some other dependencies:
    gettext - but when I installed, it said there is already a BSD gettext so
        I uninstalled.
