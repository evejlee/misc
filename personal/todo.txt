zphot:

    Match primus and see how well we recover it with
    what we currently did.

    Get some validation plots, good ones, 
    from carlos, or have him send me the data.

shears:
    regauss simulations:

    Start with high-res PSF, sigma in pixels of 5

    Gauss-Gauss
        run 00: 
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel gauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=False

            Result: Works essentially perfectly
        run 01:
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel gauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=True
            conv fft

            Result: not so great, only good to 2% at high ellip.

        run 02:
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel gauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=True
            conv fconv

            Result: Performs almost as well as analytic
            (Much slower!)

    Gauss-dgauss
        run 03: 
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel dauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=False

            Result:
        run 04:
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel dauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=True
            conv fft

            Result:

        run 05:
            objmodel gauss
            psfmodel dauss
            psf_sigma=5
            forcegauss=True
            conv fconv

            Result:




    * See what happens if I increase nsub for *not* forcegauss. It might
      be that some of the error is from that and not further downstream,e.g.
      in the fftconvolve in regauss.



    Test with old princeton file:
        Note princeton file has r+i combined, which is a bit problematic,
        but we should at least see no bias.

        * Compare in pixel coordinates.
        * Compare my equatorial rotations to those in the file.

    Match Frank's file

MaxBCG:
    
    See if mem_match_id is in my catalogs, if so we can do matches.

    Do overall total to estimate what kind of splits we can do.

    Is QSO stuff from adam in main QSO paper?

    Target Selection Overview Paper

        Describe chunks

        References to tiling stuff and brief description

    documentation 10/12
        - check the skyserver sample queries
            - fix XXX in answers to practice. Need full db for that.
            - Check the orderby example when the full data are loaded,
                as it looks for pal 5 and needs runs not in test db
