Lessons learned from weak lensing in the SDSS:

	1 Any highly significant weak lensing measurement is a large scale
	structure measurement.
	
	2 The right interpretation of these lensing measurements is in terms of
	correlation functions, not "objects".

	3 Techniques from the LSS world are useful.  A powerful framework for the
	measurements, statistical error analysis, and systematics tests.
