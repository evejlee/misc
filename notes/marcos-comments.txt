Abstract:  You should say that the derived weights are then summed in order to
create the redshift distribution.  Also in paragraph 4 and the first paragraph
of the discussion.

Section 2.1 might say "Blanco 4-meter telescope".

S 3.1 paragraph 1, "compute the binned redshift distribution"

S 3.6  Why do the biases cancel in a stack?  


Discussion:  paragraph 4, should be a comma after systematically
paragraph 6, I would say "cluster-mass cross-correlation function" or just 
"weak gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters"
