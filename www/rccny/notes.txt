Starting the server was easy.  Just under preferences start personal file
sharing.

Getting cgi+python set up took some research. These are in my bookmarks
Mac/Apache.
Main thing is adding a AddHandler .cgi line  to /etc/httpd/httpd.con
and making sure that the  ExecCGI is in my /private/etc/httpd/users/esheldon.conf

When inserting/updating sqlite database, must do connect with the
isolation_level=None keyword.  This is not in the main documentation.

The web server must be able to write to the directory containing the database
and the file itself.  I put it under /Users/data/rccny, did a chown -R www on that
directory, and then had the web-server run create_rccny_table.py to create the 
db.


Todo:
  Generalize main page code to take a dbfile.
  Add table meta containing name field and perhaps others.
