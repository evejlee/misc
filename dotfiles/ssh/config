# This section deals with port forwarding through gateways.  In all cases
# we must first set up a connection through the gateway machine.  This 
# might best done by ssh to the machine with -f to go to the background, 
# although then one must grep through ps to kill it

#
# gateway: rssh at BNL
#

# This says we forward these ports through the gateway rssh to the specified
# machine

# don't use their actual names, just in case we are on a machine local
