So, did you think you could tell

Heaven from hell?
                G
blue skies from pain?
                     D
could you tell green field
                  Am
from a cold steel rail?
               C
a smile from a veil?
                       G
did ya think you could tell
                   C

your heros for ghosts?
              Am
hot ashes for trees?
              G
hot air for a cool breeze?

we're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
D                                C
runnin over the same old ground,   but have you found
             Am                    G
the same old fears?  Wish you were here.
