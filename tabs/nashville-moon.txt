A                     E
How many ghosts will I meet on the road
     D
That depends
      A
How hard your running
A           
that depends
E                                  D                   A
Which ones you know and which ones know that you'll be coming
E                    Bm
How far away is that Nashville moon
       D
That depends
           A
Where did she leave you


A                   E
how many miles til my mistakes catch up
        D
That depends
          A
which ones you're counting
A           E
that depends
                      D      A
what you're forgetting again
E                    Bm
How far away is that Nashville moon
       D
That depends
           A
but not on you


A                E
Does it matter who's side I'm on
               D
or does that depend
 A
on the fight
A                       E
Does it matter if every star falls from the sky
                D
or does that depend 
 A
on the night
E                    Bm
How far away is that Nashville moon
        D
that depends
         A
which road your taking


A                             E
I was on that road and it was darkness end to end
                   D
well then just head for the dark
             A
you aint been facin
E                          Bm
How far am I from livin my whole life
            D               A
only in the dark, only in the dark

E              Bm                 D
I'd say friend     know that depends
            A
on how close you are
