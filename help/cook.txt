Shooter Ricks Snakebite Chicken Rub 

If you brine, should probably cut back the salt considerably

3/4 cup raw sugar
1/4 cup sea salt
1tbs red pepper flakes
1tbs garlic powder
1tbs onion powder
1tbs Hungarian Paprika
2 tsp all spice
1 tsp black pepper course
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp Wasabi powder
1 tsp cumin

Don't completely go crazy with the rub; just coat everything.

I tried without skin, worked pretty good.  But I think I should aim for 270 or
so for temp.

Pulled the breasts at 155 and they were done!!  Something wierd with my
thermometers?

Probably should wet them with an apple spray to help keep outside from getting
rubbery.  I did mop them with the rub mixed into oil, but might not have helped.

I halved this for a single rack. next time add cinnamon to this.  Sarah
thought slightly too much sugar (not me), but would have been offset had I
used more smoke I think.

1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup paprika
2 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon mustard powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cayenne
1 1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 tablespoon onion powder

They say you need 5 hours but it took me 7 and I think they could have used
more (they didn't yet pass the bend test).  They were still slightly frozen
when I took them out of the fridge which may be part of it.  Resist the urge
to stop!

bend test:  grab the rack by the end: it should bend to ~90 degrees and
you should see cracks start and meat peak through:
