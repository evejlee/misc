C intro

       C          C
When I go, when I go
           G               C
Sure don’t know, where I’m going
          F                 C
I look up high, I look down low
                          G            C
Sure don’t know where I’m going when I go

       C
Do you job and I’ll do mine
           G                C
I’ll do my best to hold the line
      F                 C
Do my best like Charlie said
                                  G                   C
You don’t eat here, you’re not to sleep, you hold the line

      F          C            E7                   Am
Oh my God, Oh my God, Charlie Darwin where are you now
  F                  C                    G
I set these tiresome codes down where you lay
      F          C             E7                        Am
Oh my God, Oh my God, it ain’t nothing but the cold hard ground

   F                C
My better half will stay 
   F                C
My better half will stay 
   F                C
My better half will stay 
    G      C
but I must go
