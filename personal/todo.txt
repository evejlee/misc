    - gmix

        - ring tests
            - gg03 1000 because it is fast
                gg03r01 - s/n 100
                gg03r01 - s/n 100
        - do S/N=100 run for et with 1000 per, adding to cache
            - running
        - run n=1000 dt01 sims
        - run n=1000 et01 sims (running now as part of et01r05)

        - some cache was generated with same seeds; I think this
        is ok for shape stuff, but not for shear tests, which we
        will have to do separately anyway.
        - get PSF working on Tfrac
        - rename Tfrac class etc.


        - it looks like my trouble with dt was partly because of a too-small
          expansion factor for the FFTs.  Using minres fix does it, but it is
          not letting up at low s2 as I would like because it sees the PSF
          still as small, but this is about cuspiness really so minres is
          overkill.  Turned off sigma *= 1.75 and I'm getting good ellip
          accuracy and better s2 at low ellip, but still highly ellip
          dependent.

          Uses lots of memory but it works!  Need to check out mapping of
          parameters now and see if that is more independent.

        - priors
            - Priors are working for the Tfrac stuff.
            - high S/N dt
                - needs tighter priors for effect. I'm able to force the sizes
                  to be what I want that way, but the tradeoff seems to be
                  worse ellip estimates.  Do better e1,e2 with weak priors.
                  Maybe they really are bigger than I think.

                  dt01r05 is running with weak priors and getting good
                  e1,e2 measurements so far.

        - implement generic multiple S/N in config?  How to
        guess at ntrial?  1000*(100/s2n)**2

    - mcmc
        - get priors right, normalization of prob

    - read ying's draft

    - figure out s2n measurement for gmix
    - gmix: need to check for centroid coincidence and drift

    - make combined mask starting with "good", excluding star, good excluding
      badfield or whatever is appropriate.
    - optionally mask around bright galaxies?

    pymangle
    - don't allow not snapped masks; problem is IDL code doesn't write it.
    - good mask is snapped, but doesn't say it because write_mangle_polygons
      didn't write it

    recfile
    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  See Rachel's stuff.

        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only


    - catalog for peter
    - sobjshear hadoop
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?

    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run (sample s06)

    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.

    shears:
        - s/g sep
        - stellar contamination
        - Match Frank's file
        - look at various local tests 
            - PSF tests need to be devised

            - <e> vs psf e
            - <e> vs position, run, etc.
