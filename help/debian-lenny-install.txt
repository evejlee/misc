got mini.iso netboot install, wrote to cd with 
	cdrecord -v dev=/dev/cdrom mini.iso
did I need to use sudo?  Don't remember.

Guided partition with lvm:
	chose whole disk with separate partition for /home
	changed /home fs to xfs
that's it.  

/boot	ext2	255Mb
lvm: name treebeard
	swap			12b
	/		ext3	7Gb # too small? I think I can resize it.
	/home	xfs		rest

When choosing packages to install, I added a check next to "File Server", which
will hopefully automatically set up ssh and samba servers.  Took defaults for
rest of install.  Note it asked for a root password. I might have to set up
sudo myself.

It asked about a workgroup name and then about modifying smb.conf to use dhcp
to get some server info or something. Not sure...

keychain
--------------
had to install askpass
aptitude install ssh-askpass-gnome

First time installing ot this problem:
error 15: file not found
when trying to load the image.  Also it said the boot area was XFS but it was not.

Turns out it was all becuase I had the external usb drive plugged in!  It got all confused about drive ids.

Will I want to install nvidia drivers?
sefdec or nonfree adobe flash plugin?

nvidia 3d acceleration
----------------------
need this to play high-res movies.

Seems that the standard tutorial, using the "debian way" to install these
doesn't work with lenny.  I'm going to do the nvidia installer route.  Note if
you had previously installed nvidia kernel modules via apt you need to remove
these.  I removed everything that came up installed with a 

	aptitude search nvidia 

Also note you will have to do this again for a new kernel.

I got the basic instructions here
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/how-to-install-nvidia-video-card-drivers-in-debian-lenny/

Here is what it said, with some modifications:

	How to install NVIDIA video card drivers in Debian Lenny:

	Note: After step 6 you will be dropped to a shell and not longer be able to
	read this page.

	   1. Open a terminal and type sudo su. Don't just use sudo since for the
	   compilation later you will need to be root due to the need to set 
	   environment variables.

	   2. Type apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
	   3. Type cd /usr/src
	   4. Type ln -s linux-headers-$(uname -r) linux

	   5. Type
		  #wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/100.14.23/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-100.14.23-pkg1.run
			wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/180.29/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-180.29-pkg2.run
			Note you should visit http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html to get the actual latest perhaps.
			(185.18.36)??

	   6. Type /etc/init.d/gdm stop (to stop gdm and drop to a terminal if in X)

	   7. Type cd /usr/src && sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-100.14.23-pkg1.run (or
	   whatever your file is, to launch the nVidia installer script)

	   Note it may fail becuase the current gcc is different than that used to
	   compile the kernel. Just make sure you are root, export CC=gcc-4.1 or
	   whatever, and rerun.

		* Accept the license agreement to continue
		* Select No on the first question prompting to download Kernel from nVidia
		* Click Ok to compile a new Kernel
		* Select No at the prompt to abort now
		* Let the installer finish the build
		* Select Yes to let nVidia-xconfig automatically update your xorg.conf file
		* Click Ok
		* Once the installer has completed, type startx and enjoy your new video hardware enabled Lenny with 
			nVidia drivers

		You can run 
			sudo nvidia-settings to set up multiple screens, set resolutions, and such.


multimedia, dvds, etc
----------------------------
Need to add multimedia repos

deb http://debian-multimedia.org/ lenny main
deb-src http://debian-multimedia.org/ lenny main

aptitude update
but it will complain about public keys.  Install
	sudo aptitude install debian-multimedia-keyring
and say yes, then again do aptitude update again and it will get the keys.

Now to decrypt the dvds you need libdvdcss2
sudo aptitude install libdvdcss2

Needed to restart before everything would work.

controlling the init.d scripts
--------------------------------
on redhat or fedora one uses ntsysv, but on debian it is rcconf.  You might
have to install it with aptitude install rcconf

thunar
----------
installed
	thunar
	thunar-volman
volman is so it will mount inserted dvds and stuff

jwm
----
installed jwm but didn't show up in the gdm sessions manager.  Had to do this:

sudo cp /usr/share/jwm/xsessions/Jwm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/

matplotlib:
------------------
Had to install this package to get latex working: texlive-latex-extra



gdl 
----- 

needed to install developement packages for ImageMagick and gsl and plplot,
possibly zlib/

Needed to add this to my path:  /usr/share/doc/gnudatalanguage/examples/pro

./configure --prefix=/home/esheldon/local/ --with-netcdf=no --with-hdf=no --with-hdf5=no
