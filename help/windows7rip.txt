I ran the installer, making sure not to be on the internet when I was
typing in the CD key.  Next time I might even just not plug it in at all.

Note there is an option during install to turn off automated updating, which I
did.

Then afterward, I immediately made sure automated updating was off.  

I then used RemoveWAT to guarantee the install would not try to activate.

    RemoveWAT22.zip

I have not performed any updates.

I installed the lateset nvidia drivers for the video card.
