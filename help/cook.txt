Shooter Ricks Snakebite Chicken Rub 

If you brine, should probably cut back the salt considerably

3/4 cup raw sugar
1/4 cup sea salt
1tbs red pepper flakes
1tbs garlic powder
1tbs onion powder
1tbs Hungarian Paprika
2 tsp all spice
1 tsp black pepper course
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp Wasabi powder
1 tsp cumin

Don't completely go crazy with the rub; just coat everything.

I tried without skin, worked pretty good.  But I think I should aim for 270 or
so for temp.

Pulled the breasts at 155 and they were done!!  Something wierd with my
thermometers?

Probably should wet them with an apple spray to help keep outside from getting
rubbery.  I did mop them with the rub mixed into oil, but might not have helped.

ribs
=========

I halved this for a single rack. next time add cinnamon to this.  Sarah
thought slightly too much sugar (not me), but would have been offset had I
used more smoke I think.

1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup paprika
2 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon mustard powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cayenne
1 1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 tablespoon onion powder

cooking baby backs

They say you need 5 hours but it took me 7 and I think they could have used
more (they didn't yet pass the bend test).  They were still slightly frozen
when I took them out of the fridge which may be part of it.  Resist the urge
to stop!

bend test:  grab the rack by the end: it should bend to ~90 degrees and
you should see cracks start and meat peak through:

This time I did ~8 hours; good but too hard bark.

Wine went  well:  Dry riesling (Chateah St. Michelle, Columbia valley 2011)

trying 3-2-1
------------
    - 3 hours of smoke
    - 2 hours wrapped in foil
    - 1 hour out of foil; put on sauce if you have it


briscuit
--------

The plan
    
    Cook right on grill until the stall at about ~150-160, take it off
    and wrap in foil until 190-195, take back out and finish it on
    the grill till 205.

    Two smoke boxes of chips at the biginning and another at the end.

What happened

    took it out of wrap at at 190, but it then dropped to 163!  It did
    get a good smoking at this time and probably improved the bark,but it was
    in the stall.  I decided to re-wrap and took it all the way to 205.

    It turned out delicious!  It was a bit dry in the middle but parts of
    it were amazing.

next time

    I'm not sure
        
        - could do it exactly the same!  But if the dryness in certain parts
        was because of my errors then this is not a good idea.  But who knows?

        - could leave it in the foil till 205 and then just put it back on
        the grill at lower heat for a while to firm up.  Would want to make
        sure the heat is low, maybe under 200.  175?
