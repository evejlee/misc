Would not boot, got circle with slash through it.

Boot in verbose mode got "error loading kernel 'mach_kernel'"

I connected to my other mac via firewire and held "t" which will mount the
hard drive on my computer.  Copied all recently changed files off (sarah
had not done a recent backup) but could not copy one directory.

Put in the leopard disk and restarted holding "c" then after clicking
english when to utilities menu and "disk utility" and repaired drive.
This succeeded and said volume appears to be OK.

rebooted but still got the circle with a slash through it.

going to try a reinstall:
	I found out the one directory we couldn't get was not important so I
	opted for erase and install.

	I set it going and went to work....
	it worked!  Now I need to find my iWork disk
