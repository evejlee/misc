If you install your own readline, you need to do this before compiling

export LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/readline/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/readline/include"

this also seems to work with bzip2

export LDFLAGS="-L/home/esheldon/exports/readline/5.2/lib -L/home/esheldon/exports/bzip2/1.0.5/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/esheldon/exports/readline/5.2/include -I/home/esheldon/exports/bzip2/1.0.5/include"

export LDFLAGS="-L/home/esheldon/exports/tcl/8.5.8/lib -L/home/esheldon/exports/tk/8.5.8/lib -L/home/esheldon/exports/readline/5.2/lib -L/home/esheldon/exports/bzip2/1.0.5/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/esheldon/exports/tcl/8.5.8/include -I/home/esheldon/exports/tk/8.5.8/include  -I/home/esheldon/exports/readline/5.2/include -I/home/esheldon/exports/bzip2/1.0.5/include"
