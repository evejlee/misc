Enabling Bitmapped Fonts

If you'd like to use a fixed font in your terminal, use these commands:

cd /etc/fonts/conf.d/
sudo rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/10* && sudo rm -rf 70-no-bitmaps.conf && sudo ln -s
../conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf .
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig

Logout, and log back in again, and you'll be able to select some new fixed
fonts in your gnome-terminal or XFCE terminal's or profile. This was tested on
Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) 

Also to get fonts to work in my ~/.fonts directory have to run mkfontdir
~/.fonts
