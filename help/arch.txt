Working on treebeard.

Dual booting

windows is on sda
install on sdb


I did the auto-configure of partitions on sdb.  All should work pretty easily.

For packages, I didn't check the full dev box, but i might need a lot of that
stuff later.


grub
------

remember, you *do* want to install grub on the MBR of sda!

/boot/grub/menu.lst

You'll have to edit this

To get dual booting with windows uncomment the end
stuff for windows in /boot/grub/menu.lst but not
the makeactive since this is windows 7


Also, it will write the wrong /boot/grub/menu.lst and you'll have to rename to

    vmlinuz26               becomes     vmlinuz-linux
    kernel26.img            becomes     initramfs-linux.img
    kernel26-fallback.img   becomes     initramfs-linux-fallback.img

This might not happen if you do the non net-install


Now I boot up and all is well!


All that is running outside the kernel is

    - system log
    - crod
    - dhcpd
