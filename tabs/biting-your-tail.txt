Capo 2

C May your eyes be wide and seeing
F May you learn from the view where you’re kneeling
C Know the fear of the world that you’re feeling
G Is the fear of a slave


C May you know how the fight was started
F And want as much from the snake as the garden
C                       G                 C
  Wear em both like a glove that you can wave


C May your mouth betray your wisdom
F May you get what they failed to mention
C May your love be your only religion
G Preach it to us all


C May you lose what you offer gladly
F May you worship the time and it’s passing
C                    G                      C
  Stars wont ever wait for you to watch em fall

(One Strum each)
Am We’re the smoke on a burned horizon
F We’re the boat on a tide that’s rising
C Both the post and the pig you’re untying
G Butcher gone for the blade

Am Someday we may all be happy
F Someday all make a face worth slapping
C Someday we may be shocked to be laughing
G At the way we behave

(Normal)
C May your tongue be something wicked
F May you know when to speak and to listen
C May you find every friend that you’re missing
G There’s no check in the mail

C May you end it bruised and purple
F And know that peace is the shape of a circle
C                                G              C
  Cause round and around you'll go, biting your tail


(instrumental interlude)

(Normal)
Am We're the children the wind is whipping
F the short hands on a clock still ticking
C Both the egg and the red fox grinning
G His belly full for the day

Am Someday we may all want nothing
F And all forget that we’ll get what’s coming
C Someday all say the world was something
G That we just couldn’t change

(One Strum each)
C May your hands be strong and willing
F Know your part in the calf and the killing
C See straight through the captain you’re kissing
G The helm loose in his hand


(Normal)
C May your words be well worth stealing
F an' put your hand on your heart when you're singing
C                          G                             C
  The choir’s sick of the song but they still got to stand.
