    nersc

        - cfitsio globally as cfitsio-des?
        - CCfits globally as ccfits-des
        - can get web access for files: access for apache but not other
          groups.
        - hopper much faster to global scratch
        - back up our data (meds) figure out tape archival needs.  Ask for
          more through salman.

        usage
        - prjquota des

    - eli prioritizes doing masses for sdss red mapper over new colors

        - try also with s/n cut at 10 or 15

        - randoms from eli
            - eli has his own weights for randoms that I need to apply before
              doing the weighted histogram matching thing.  Not sure how that
              will work out.

    DES

        - get seg for spt east
        - calibrate the SE images
            - sent email to bob
        - get outlier pixel rejection, features etc. from Daniel
            - sent email to daniel
        - psf size vs mag
            - Gary argues don't want poisson weighting
        - convert coadd to wget as well

        - people look at SE images for coadds and help determine what SE
          images we should use for multi-epoch analysis
            - Eric will start
            - pre-generate and let people look through them
        - Daniel says weight map might have wrong normalization

    ideas
        - my stack images but going to Fourier space (Gary)
        - shear response by deconvolving PSF, shear,
          then reconv. with slightly larger PSF (Eric)

    peter
        - sky sub is bad

    wlpipe
        Finish Convert shapelets to new script stuff
    MEDS
        In api, generate some useful filenames automatically,
            e.g. psfex file, fitpsf.
        Write integer metadata.
        C getter for metadata?
        Add $DESDATA to the metadata?

    gsim
        - pad against largest dimension instead of average
        - generate psf on a grid but at different sub-pixel locations


    recfile
    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  See Rachel's stuff.

        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only


    - sobjshear hadoop
        - need concatenation of lens outputs when we did lens splits.  to be
          done during reduce or before?
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?

    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run

    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.


DES:

objshear
    kathy romer, chris miller catalogs

    shears:
        - s/g sep
        - stellar contamination
        - Match Frank's file
        - look at various local tests 
            - PSF tests need to be devised
            - <e> vs R
            - <e> vs psf e
            - <e> vs position, run, etc.
