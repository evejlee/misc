Avett Brothers

Capo on two.

G
She keeps it simple
                                  C
And I am thankful for her kind of lovin'
            G
'Cause it's simple

G
No longer do we wonder if we're together
          C
We're way past that
                 G
And I've already asked her
      D                     C
So in January we're gettin' married

G
She's talkin' to me with her voice
                     C
Down so low I barely hear her
G
But I know what she's sayin'
                        C                      G
I understand because my heart and hers are the same
       D                     C
And in January we're gettin' married

G
And I was sick with heartache
                             C              G
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her
G
But we would not surrender
                             C                     G
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down

      Am           C
Don't ever turn it down

G
I hope that I don't sound too insane when I say
         C             G
There is darkness all around us
G                                                    C
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me
    G                   C               G
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin'
      D                     C
So in January we're gettin' married

[quiet]
G                                                   C
No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in
G
She knows which birds are singin'
                                         C                 G
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin'
       D                     C
And in January we're gettin' married
     Am                C
Come January let's get married

G
