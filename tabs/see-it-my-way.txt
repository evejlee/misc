    G
The thunder rolls its angry arms
C                          G
Across my shoulders in the dark
                 D
Maybe I'm losing ground

    G
But I can see a million miles through that 
C
dark when the lights are on 
G                             D
you I'll make it back to your door

            G   
just let me back in the boat let me back in your arms
       C
Let me cry to the wind
                   G
I know you need me babe
                         D (only a 4 count)
Regardless of what you'll say

C                                                  G      C
Oh I know, I know you see it, I know you'll see it my, my way

    G
And every hour that passes now
C                              G
All our dreams like embers falling
                             D
like hollow footsteps in the hall

     G
Stay with me now stay while I sleep
       C                           G
Oh the wind and the waters calling me
                                D
Cause I'll make it back to your shore
(I know I will)




          G
So let me back in the boat let me back in your arms
       C
Let me cry to the wind
                   G
I know you need me babe
                          D
Regardless of what you'll say

C                                               G       C
Oh I, I know you see it, and I know I see it my way, my way

          G
so let me back in the boat, let me back in your arms
       C
Let me cry to the wind
                   G
I know you need me babe
                       D
Regardless of what you say

C                                                    G       C
Oh I, I know you see it, and I know you'll see it my way, my way
                                                     G
I'll know you'll see it, and I know you'll see it my way
