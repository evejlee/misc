ESS Notes:

The Cunha et al. paper recommend 5 nearest neighbors for the 
weights calculation.  If you want a p(z) for each object, use
100 nearest neighbors in the p(z) call.  The parameter is called
the same thing so be careful not to confuse them.

My function calls:

    ./calcweights trainfile photofile n_near weightsfile numfile

        * n_near=5

You should /only/ use photo objects that have nonzero values in
the numfile.

    ./pofz weightsfile photofile n_near nz res zmin zmax pzfile gridfile

        * n_near=100
        * weightsfile is the weightsfile output by calcweights above
        * pzfile has the first two columns from photofile and then the p(z)
        * nz is number of bins (called GRID below)
        * res tells us if we should smooth the histogramming.  res=1 means
          no smoothing, higher means more smoothing.  res=2 in Carlos' paper
          I think.

Code restructuring:
    Instead of using global functions d() for distances
    between points and hcubes, these classes now can compute
    distances using their dist() methods.

    Class names start with a capital and are generally in
    separate header files.  E.g. Point.h, KDTree.h, etc.
    
    The Catalog class can read/write files of the basic type
    described below.

    vectors are preferred over arrays and pointers; makes the code shorter and
    memory safe.  E.g. the nneigh methods of KDTree now take vectors.

    TODO:
        make number of dimensions configurable instead of hard wired
        in params.h as NDIM

-------------------------------
Weights code:
-------------------------------

- To extract the folder where the code is type: tar -xvzf weights.tgz 
- This will create a directory called 'weights'. In the directory, type 'make'
- To run the code with the example files, type: ./weights.x train.tbl photo.tbl NNEI

The files train.tbl and photo.tbl are example files that I included. 
The train.tbl file contains the training set, that is, the sample with known spectroscopic redshifts.
The photo.tbl is the photometric set, that is, the sample whose redshift distribution (or any other 
redshift statistics) you want to estimate.
The format for the train.tbl and photo.tbl files is: zspec, anything1, anything2, observables (5).
The zspec column in the photo.tbl file is not used by the algorithm, but it must be there.
'NNEI' speficies the number of nearest neighbors used in the weights calculation.
The code (calcWeights.cpp) is set to use 5 observables. 
To change this, you must (unfortunately) go inside the code and manually change the value passed to the variable "dim". 
The kd-tree algorithm assumes all observables are in the range [-50:50]. 
To change this range, edit the value of the variable "big" inside kdtrees.h.
In the example files I've used simulated SDSS ugriz magnitudes. For SDSS data, I've gotten better 
results using the 4 colors + r-magnitude.
We're still working on finding the optimal combination of observables.  

Outputs:
nnweight.prw: Almost identical to train.tbl, except that the third column now contains the weights assigned 
to that training set object.
phot.num: Contains the first two columns of photo.tbl plus an additional column with the number of times 
the corresponding photometric 
object was used in the weights calculation. 
If this number is zero, the object was not used, hence the weights estimate is not taking it into account. 
In the language of Cunha et al (2009), this object is not part of the recoverable photometric set.
By trial and error, we've found that 5 nearest neighbor is a good number of nearest neighbors to use when estimating the
recoverable photometric set.

Tips: For large training and photometric sets, we find that the results are very insensitive to the number 
of nearest neighbors used.
For small training and/or photometric sets, the number of nearest neighbors can matter a little. 
Typically, less neighbors is better.
However, if one is going to use the p(z) code, it is better if the number of nearest neighbors 
for the weights and p(z) calculation match.
In this case, a large number of neighbors is required, if one is to get meaningful p(z) estimates. 
Our practice is to use 100 neighbors usually.
In this case, one is advised to run the weights code with less neighbors to estimate the recoverable training set. 
Then, remove objects with weight=0 and calculate the weights using 100 nearest neighbors. 

When the photometric sample is small, we've often found it useful to progressively reduce the size of 
the training set by removing training set objects with weight=0, and recalculating using less nearest neighbors. 
For example, perform the weights calculations with 100 NN. Remove all
training set objects with weight=0. Re-run the code using only 20 nearest neighbors. Cull the objects with weights=0. 
Keep going until nearest neighbors is very small - 1, or 2 nearest neighbors is not bad, though 5 may be enough. 
This procedure is mostly useful to reduce boundary effects, in cases where the photometric set has a strange selection.

Of course, the best number of nearest neighbors to use will vary with catalogs. 
So, make sure you experiment with a few different values.

-------------------------------
p(z) code
-------------------------------

- To extract the folder where the code is type: tar -xvzf pofz.tgz 
- In the directory created, type make
- To run, type: ./pofz.x training photometric NNEI Grid  Res  (zmin  zmax)

The training file should be whatever is output from the weights code (format:  zspec, anything1, weights, observables (5))
The photometric file should be the photo.tbl. 
The number of observables is currently set to 5.  To change this, you must (unfortunately) 
go inside the code and manually change the value passed to the variable "dim". 
If the training set is representative, then one does not need to run the weights code. 
In this case, the third column of the training input file should be set to a fixed number.
NNEI indicates the number of nearest neighbors used to estimate p(z).
GRID: number of bins used to generate the p(z) histograms
RES: how much smoothing will be performed (RES=GRID corresponds to no smoothing, the smaller the value of RES, 
the larger the smoothing, with RES =1 being the limit).
zmin, zmax (optional): redshift limits of the p(z) histogram. Defaults are zmin=0 and zmax=1.0

Outputs:
output.grid: file containing the centroids of the bins for the p(z) histograms
output.etbl: zspec, anything1, p(z_i) (i=1...GRID)


For more details, read Cunha, et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.2991)

ESS: In that paper, RES=2 worked well, and I think they used a z range
of 0.0 1.1 from the figures.


-------------------------------
NNE code
-------------------------------

- To extract the folder where the code is type: tar -xvzf nne.tgz 
- In the directory created, type make
- To run, type: ./nne.x train.nne.tbl photo.nne.tbl 

The files train.nne.tbl and photo.nne.tbl are example files that I included. 
The train.nne.tbl file contains the training set, that is, the sample with known spectroscopic redshifts.
The photo.nne.tbl is the photometric set, that is, the sample whose redshift distribution (or any 
other redshift statistics) you want to estimate.
The format for the train.tbl files is: zspec, zphot, weights, observables (5).
The format for the photo.tbl files is: zspec, zphot, anything2, observables (5).
The zspec column in the photo.tbl file is not used by the algorithm, but it must be there.
The photo-z's from any algorithm can be used, though we found better results when training set methods were used.
The weights don't make much difference when estimating the error, so, for test runs, you can just set them 
to 1 to save time. 
In a serious run it's safer to use the proper weights.
However, the weights code is important in defining the "recoverable" part of the photometric set
(see Cunha, et al. 2009 [arXiv:0810.2991] for the definition of recoverable)

The error estimate outputted by the NNE code is the 68% width of the (zphot-ztrue) distribution.
Contrast this to the p(z) code which is an estimator of p(ztrue).
Other measures of width can easily be put it, one can also use a width estimated from the p(z) 
instead of the p(zphot-ztrue). 
The number of neighbors used to estimate the distribution is set to 100.
The number of observables is currently set to 5.  To change this, you must (unfortunately) 
go inside the code and manually change the value passed to the variable "dim". 



Outputs:
output.etbl: zspec, zphot, error, observables (5).
