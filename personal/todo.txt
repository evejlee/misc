        - seeing b modes in the lensing at very large radius
            - source catalogs tried:
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > 1
                - s/n [20,300] sratio > sqrt(2)
        - going to try the maxlike version

        - cfitsio globally as cfitsio-des?
        - CCfits globally as ccfits-des
        - can get web access for files: access for apache but not other
          groups.
        - hopper much faster to global scratch
        - back up our data (meds) figure out tape archival needs.  Ask for
          more through salman.

        - redo colors in MEDS
            - For matched fit, need to be able to specify the run of a
              detband, since runs and bands are tied together.  det_run= could
              in principle imply the filename for the det_cat.

            - need to trim objects I process I think.  Too many taking forever
              and failing.
            - module in deswl
                - need a code in gmix_meds to concatenate these together
                  and sort by id
            - /bin/gmix-meds --range start,end config_file meds_file out_file
            - use lm_max_try=2 for everything but the coelliptical psf fit
                about 2% of failures find a fit on the 2nd try.  Fewer
                beyond that.

            - better way to get seg map id when seg maps are proper?  should
              use coadd seg map in sky space some how?
            - cmodel error ignores  frac_dev error

            - need to decide what to do if psf fitting fails
                - currently just moving on

            - explore using EM and non-coelliptical fits to PSF
                - remove all the cocenter,coellip crap from
                the EM code
                - get working on sky coords

            - need to possibly store the psf fits in a separate
            file or extension.

            - ~aperture corrections on psfflux: put back difference
                from model and psf image

                    flux = flux*(1+(model-psfimage)/psfimage)

                how to do on stack?  average that frac diff?

            - I think Flux fitter should just inherit from Base
            - should we use the lowest_psum?
            - bulge+disk?
                - coelliptical would add two parameters

                    [cen1,cen2,e1,e2,T1,T2,p1,p2]

                and we are back to similar situation as coelliptical
                gaussians, which just don't work that well.  bdco

            - very long term
                - sersic?
                - run Hoggs code on a closely spaced grid of n?

            - when gauss is psf, 2 won't fit well; might want fallback to 1
              gauss.
            - need seg maps!  Also need to make sure we download all the
              g,r,i,z images for the spte runs.

    ideas
        - my stack images but going to Fourier space (Gary)
        - shear response by deconvolving PSF, shear,
          then reconv. with slightly larger PSF (Eric)

    MEDS
        
        - add id back into meds
        - Add $DESDATA to the metadata
        - make some metadata not string, if they exist

        In api, generate some useful filenames automatically,
            e.g. psfex file, fitpsf.
        Write integer metadata.

    gsim
        - pad against largest dimension instead of average
        - generate psf on a grid but at different sub-pixel locations


    recfile
    - strings passed in might disappear!  Just do delim as char.
      and copy delim[0] from input
    - unit test structured subarray for binary
    - document the _method stuff too, where necessary
    - can just use memmap for binary (problem on OSX)?  Extracting multiple
      columns using memmap and looping over rows or reading in chunks (latter
      don't even need memmap)?
    - can optimize reading specified binary rows when they are *consecutive*.
      Same with cols.
    - fread style change?


    - tmv+wl using intel, with openmp
        - Mike says you can compile tmv with openmp and it won't
        - mess up our method of using openmp in the outer loop

    - shears

        - propagate corrections into the covariance matrix
            - could just get new diagonal errors and scale correlation matrix
            - could correct each delta sigma individually and derive new
              covariance matrices

        - s/g sep in BOSS catalog.  See Rachel's stuff.

        - re-run source catalog without masking, and just have masks in the
          collated columns
            - not crucial since currently aren't referencing that cut anywhere
              else, e.g. randoms are "good" mask only


    - sobjshear hadoop
        - need concatenation of lens outputs when we did lens splits.  to be
          done during reduce or before?
        - do we need the index-tab at beginning? Can we just use zindex-tab?

    - get details on pre-matching in mangle
    - add match structures and sorting to smatch
    - do a r < 21.8 run

    - faster masking edge stuff

    - Think about masking bias
    - Are our bright star masks aggressive enough?

    - Try to make ctrl-c work for cxOracle
    - implement SessionPool on my wrapped oracle connection.

fitsio

    - refactor images/tables

    - practice with object arrays.

    - We should just use the offset reading for everything row and column
      based, it is more general and should not incur any slowdown.  This will
      facilitate the vararray stuff too, since we will have to update fewer
      functions.

    - vararray: make get_rec_dtype to return a list of offsets and a bool array
      whether this is a vararray or not.  There will also be a new keyword for
      vtype='fixed' or vtype='object'.  Then use the offset code for reading
      those, copying in vararray stuff after as either the 

    -  Convert the "read as list" code to read into an array of objects, and
       make sure you use the stride.  For copying into the fixed length arrays,
       and copy that result into the rec array, but probably should have a
       separate code for reading these since that involves inefficiecies.
