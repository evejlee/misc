C                  G                      C
I'm learnin how to deal with all of these changes
C                   G            C
They bringin pain I really don't need right now
    F
But change'l come whether I like it or not
      G                            C
don't hold on, just roll with them changes

  C             G            C
I know now that change has a nature of pain
        C          G         C
or some pain has a nature of change
    F
but change aint goin anywhere
   G                               C
so learn to see the true nature of change

F                                  C
I lash out when I leave the ones I love
  F                              C
I hold on to the man that I once was, or thought I was
  F                                    C
I see in people the things I want them to be

Am                            D7
But that aint gonna happen no more
