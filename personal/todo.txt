zphot:

    Match primus and see how well we recover it with
    what we currently did.

    Get some validation plots, good ones, 
    from carlos, or have him send me the data.

shears:
    regauss simulations:

        I may be seeing some affects:
            1) Increasing the resolution increases stability. e.g. increasing
                the PSF size to 2.5'' at fixed pixel scale (0.4) I can now 
                meausure spsf2/sgal2 = 2.0 objects.

            2) I modified the size of the object to be at least the size of the
                PSF.  We'll see if this improves things for very small spsf2/sgal2.
                WHAT about real data, does this mean anything?

    Test with old princeton file:
        Note princeton file has r+i combined, which is a bit problematic,
        but we should at least see no bias.

        * Compare in pixel coordinates.
        * Compare my equatorial rotations to those in the file.

    Match Frank's file

MaxBCG:
    
    See if mem_match_id is in my catalogs, if so we can do matches.

    Do overall total to estimate what kind of splits we can do.

    Is QSO stuff from adam in main QSO paper?

        - check the skyserver sample queries
            - fix XXX in answers to practice. Need full db for that.
            - Check the orderby example when the full data are loaded,
                as it looks for pal 5 and needs runs not in test db
