(verse 1)
     E
     We were born before the wind
     E
     Also younger than the sun
     B
     'Ere the bonny boat was won
     B                     E
     As we sailed into the mystic

(verse 2)
     E
     Hark, now, hear the sailor's cry
     E
     Smell the sea and feel the sky
     B
     Let your soul and spirit fly
     B          E
     Into the mystic.
